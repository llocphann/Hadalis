# iNiR Architecture

> A complete desktop shell built on [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org/) for the [Niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) Wayland compositor.

**Version**: 2.29.3 · **Stack**: QML (Quickshell), Bash, Python, Go

Originally forked from [end-4/dots-hyprland](https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland) (illogical-impulse). Secondary Hyprland support is maintained.

---

## Entry Point

`shell.qml` → `ShellRoot` (Quickshell-specific root, not Item/Window).

Startup flow:
1. Environment pragmas configure Qt scale, WebEngine, etc.
2. Singleton services force-instantiated via dummy property bindings.
3. `Config.ready` triggers panel loading.
4. Theme and icon services are applied via `Qt.callLater`.
5. Hyprsunset, first-run wizard, and conflict killer are loaded.

## Panel Families

Two mutually exclusive UI families are switchable at runtime (`Super+Shift+W`):

| | **Material ii** | **Waffle** |
|---|---|---|
| Active when | `panelFamily !== "waffle"` | `panelFamily === "waffle"` |
| Visual tokens | `Appearance.*` | `Looks.*` |
| Global theme | Material only | Waffle is a separate Fluent panel family, not a Global Theme |
| Bar | **Classic Bar only** — top/bottom/left/right; Hug/Float/Rectangle/Card geometry | Bottom Windows 11-style taskbar |
| App launcher | Overview | StartMenu with search |
| Right panel | SidebarRight + bottom-right Notification Center | ActionCenter + NotificationCenter |
| Panels | ii (`iiBar`, `iiDock`, `iiSidebarLeft`, ...) | w (`wBar`, `wStartMenu`, `wActionCenter`, ... + shared ii panels) |

The retired Bar renderer families (Islands, Scenic, Frame, M3 and Pill) are not runtime alternatives. Shared `island`, `pill` and `m3*` names may still appear where they describe unrelated live skins, widget shapes, Material color tokens, or other non-Bar behavior.

Each panel uses `PanelLoader` (LazyLoader wrapper):
```qml
PanelLoader {
    identifier: "iiBar"
    extraCondition: !(Config.options?.bar?.vertical ?? false)
    component: Bar {}
}
```

A panel loads only when `Config.ready`, its identifier is present in `enabledPanels`, and its `extraCondition` is true.

`Appearance.globalStyle` is runtime-clamped to `material`. Persisted legacy style values are migration input only and must not reactivate alternate shell-wide renderers.

Orbit, Mascot, Workspace Strip, and the retired Bar renderer modules are intentionally absent from the live module graph.

## Config System

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Schema | `modules/common/Config.qml` — `JsonAdapter` |
| Defaults | `defaults/config.json` |
| User file | `~/.config/illogical-impulse/config.json` (legacy namespace from fork origin) |
| Read | `Config.options.path.to.key` |
| Write | `Config.setNestedValue("path.to.key", value)` |
| Ready gate | `Config.ready` |
| Hot reload | `watchChanges: true` |
| Debounce | 50 ms for reads and writes |

When adding a live config key, update together:
1. `modules/common/Config.qml` schema/default.
2. Consumer(s).
3. Settings UI for the owning family.
4. `defaults/config.json` only when the curated fresh-install preference differs.

Unknown/stale JSON keys are not schema-backed runtime features and must not recreate retired surfaces. `Config.qml` also intentionally keeps the custom-widget persistence workaround outside the `JsonAdapter`; do not collapse `customWidgetData` into the adapter without re-validating the VME crash workaround.

## Classic Bar Baseline

`modules/bar/` is the only ii Bar runtime. `modules/settings/BarConfig.qml` configures the same runtime rather than choosing a renderer family.

Supported baseline behavior includes:
- top, bottom, left, and right placement through `bar.bottom` + `bar.vertical`;
- one structural Hug surface; persisted `bar.cornerStyle` and `bar.showBackground` values are normalized at startup and never become selectable renderers;
- height, active rounding, background opacity, and borderless controls;
- Screen Edge width/radius/physical-shadow controls colocated with Bar appearance because that frame owns the Bar's physical perimeter;
- Classic audio spectrum settings;
- auto-hide, edge reveal, push-windows, and Super-key reveal (`bar.autoHide.showWhenPressingSuper`);
- clock, module order, workspaces, tray, resources, media, notifications, and utility modules.

Existing bar popups use `modules/bar/StyledPopup.qml`. That popup abstraction now composes the shared Connected Perimeter geometry/frame/mask primitives, so connected edge-attached presentation is the default popup path without a new user-facing toggle.

Waffle remains a separate panel family with its own taskbar settings and is not a Classic Bar appearance.

## Dock Baseline

The ii Dock remains a separate application surface from Waffle's taskbar. **Panel** is the only supported user-facing Dock style. `modules/settings/DockConfig.qml` no longer exposes Pill/macOS/Island/M3 style choices, and `SettingsPageRegistry.qml` normalizes legacy persisted `dock.style` values to `panel` during startup.

Waffle is a panel family, not a Dock style, and must not be folded into Dock style migration.

## Key Singletons

| Singleton | Domain |
|-----------|--------|
| `Config` | Shell-wide config read/write |
| `Appearance` | ii/shared visual tokens |
| `Translation` | English-only shell UI lookup (`en_US`) |
| `GlobalStates` | Panel visibility state |
| `DevNavigation` | Development-only semantic navigation |
| `Looks` | Waffle visual tokens |
| `NiriService` | Niri IPC, workspaces, windows |
| `Audio` | PipeWire volume/mute/mixer |
| `CompositorService` | Niri/Hyprland detection |
| `Weather` | Weather polling and location |
| `Network` | NetworkManager integration |
| `Wallpapers` | Wallpaper management and theming |
| `DesktopItems` | Desktop item persistence + undo |
| `DesktopWidgetLayout` | Per-output desktop-widget layout |
| `LyricsService` | Synchronized media lyrics |

Wallpaper pickers apply through `Wallpapers.applySelectionTarget()`. Live preview goes through `Wallpapers.previewWallpaper()` and does not write config or regenerate colors. `modules/background/Background.qml` owns the per-output desktop surface; desktop widget instances are mapped through `Config.options.background.widgets.outputOverrides`, `screenList`, and `layerOrder`.

These are stability boundaries: verify all dependents before reshaping them.

## Settings Compatibility

Settings page indices can be persisted externally, so retired slots remain compatibility concerns even when their UI is gone. The registry keeps retired indices hidden and redirects legacy selections instead of exposing the old feature pages. Historical TLP page index **28** continues to redirect to **System**.

The same registry owns startup compatibility normalization for retired Dock style values and legacy shell UI locale values. `dock.style` converges to `panel`; `language.ui` converges to canonical `en_US`.

This compatibility layer must never revive Orbit, Mascot, Workspace Strip, or a retired Bar renderer.

## IPC System

Handlers are registered with `IpcHandler { target: "name" }` and invoked with:

```text
inir <target> <function> [args]
```

The always-instantiated `dev` target provides session-only semantic navigation for lazy UI:
- `list()` — registered destinations as JSON;
- `open(destination)` — navigate to a named surface/view;
- `close()` — close navigable surfaces;
- `current()` — current destination or `"closed"`.

All IPC functions declare return types. Full reference: [docs/IPC.md](docs/IPC.md).

`taskview` remains a live shell route and maps to the normal Overview/task-view state; it is not an Orbit compatibility route.

## Theming Pipeline

Colors flow:

`wallpaper image → generate_colors_material.py → colors.json → MaterialThemeLoader → Appearance tokens → UI`

Theme generation is orchestrated by `scripts/colors/applycolor.sh`, which updates supported terminal, prompt, launcher, GTK, browser/editor and related application themes.

Names such as `m3primary`, `m3surface`, etc. are Material color-token identifiers and are not the retired M3 Bar renderer.

## Distribution

```bash
git clone https://github.com/llocphann/Hadalis.git
cd Hadalis
./setup
./setup install -y
./setup update
./setup doctor
./setup rollback
```

Two install modes are tracked in `version.json`:
- **Repo-sync**: `./setup install` → syncs to `~/.config/quickshell/inir/`.
- **Package-managed**: `make install` → copies to `/usr/share/quickshell/inir/`.

User config for running QML remains at `~/.config/illogical-impulse/config.json`. Shell scripts/CLI default to `~/.config/inir/` with a legacy fallback; those namespaces are not yet unified.

## Migrations

Migrations live under `sdata/migrations/`.
- append-only;
- idempotent;
- never rename/reorder/delete an existing migration;
- choose the next number from the current highest migration.

## Daily Development

```bash
inir run
inir restart
inir logs | tail -50
inir status
inir doctor
inir settings

inir <target> <function> [args...]
inir overview toggle
inir audio volumeUp
```

Never run raw `qs kill -c inir` / `qs -c inir` by hand. iNiR runs under `inir.service` (`systemd --user`); `inir restart` is the supported forced restart path.

## Connected Perimeter Status

Connected Perimeter has two distinct runtime roles that must not be conflated:

- **Connected popup presentation is active by default** for existing ii bar popups through `StyledPopup.qml`. `ConnectedSurfaceGeometry` and `ConnectedSurfaceRevealClip` retain the slide-only lifecycle, while `ConnectedSurfaceIrisFrame` renders the exact iRiS v2.31.0 SDF union in the Overlay window using Top-layer Bar/Screen Edge owner records without repainting those owners. `ConnectedSurfaceBodyMask` keeps compositor input on the revealed rounded body only. Legacy `ConnectedSurfaceFrame` / `ConnectedSurfaceMask` remain available for Waffle and non-cutover shared surfaces; they are no longer the ii StyledPopup renderer.
- **Full `iiPerimeter` composition ownership remains guarded/opt-in** through `PerimeterCutoverPolicy.qml`. The configurable topology, registry/hosting, anchors, routing, reservations, and module adapters exist, but broad cutover must remain disabled whenever it would drop functionality that the legacy composition still provides.

Detailed contracts and local visual acceptance steps live in `docs/PERIMETER.md` and `docs/SHELL_SURFACE_CONTRACTS.md`.

## Localization Contract

Shell UI localization is English-only. `services/Translation.qml` exposes canonical `en_US`, loads `translations/en_US.json`, and does not scan or generate alternate locale catalogs. Legacy persisted `language.ui` values are normalized to `en_US` during startup. Locale/time formatting controls remain separate from shell UI language.

## Known Harmless Warnings

These log messages are safe to ignore:
- `Failed to create DBusObjectManagerInterface for "org.bluez"` — no Bluetooth adapter;
- `failed to register listener: ...PolicyKit1...` — another polkit agent running;
- `QSGPlainTexture: Mipmap settings changed` — Qt cosmetic;
- `Cannot open: file:///...coverart/...` — missing album-art cache;
- `$HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE is unset` — expected when running on Niri.
