# Hadalis — v1.0 Release Plan / Development Contract

> This README is the current product and execution contract for completing **Hadalis 1.0**.
> It intentionally contains only active requirements, release blockers, architecture constraints and validation gates. Historical implementation notes, one-off commit hashes and stale migration narratives belong in Git history / `CHANGELOG.md`, not here.
>
> **Target:** `1.0`  
> **Primary development branch:** `dev`  
> **Stable baseline:** `stable`  
> **Scope refresh:** 2026-09-17

## 1. Source-of-truth and workflow

Requirement precedence:

1. the maintainer's newest explicit instruction;
2. this README's active v1.0 scope and architecture constraints;
3. the current implementation on `dev`;
4. `stable` only as a behavioral/architectural comparison baseline;
5. older docs, historical notes and retired implementation details.

Working rules:

- Work directly on **`dev`** unless the maintainer explicitly requests another branch.
- Refetch the latest **`dev` and `stable`** before every significant group of changes and immediately before a write that may conflict with concurrent work.
- Re-read the current target file and its caller/consumer before changing architecture.
- Do **not** create a pull request unless explicitly requested.
- Do **not** depend on GitHub Actions for the current development cycle; the maintainer performs the authoritative local test pass.
- Keep commits focused and fix forward. Do not rewrite shared history.
- Canonical local validator: `bash scripts/validate-maintainer-local.sh`.
- A task is not release-complete merely because code exists. Runtime-sensitive items remain open until locally validated on the intended desktop environment.

## 2. v1.0 product direction

Hadalis remains a Quickshell desktop shell built on the existing iNiR architecture. The v1.0 priority is **UI/UX quality without throwing away working iNiR behavior**.

Required direction:

- preserve existing iNiR services, state, routing, popup contents and proven interaction behavior;
- use **Caelestia as the visual/composition reference** for connected edge surfaces;
- make popups appear to grow/morph from their real source surface instead of looking like detached floating cards;
- keep keyboard focus, Escape close, outside-click close, hover transfer, multi-output ownership and compositor behavior intact;
- prefer shared fixes in existing abstractions over per-popup forks;
- **do not build a second popup framework**;
- Niri remains the primary compositor target; preserve existing Hyprland compatibility;
- Waffle remains a supported separate panel family and must not be removed as part of ii/perimeter cleanup;
- **Material is the only supported Global Theme for v1.0.** All other Global Theme families, selectors, runtime branches and stale compatibility paths must be removed unless a narrow migration shim is required only to normalize old persisted values to Material.

Retired per-component renderer/style experiments must not be revived merely to preserve obsolete configuration values.

## 3. v1.0 release blockers

Checkboxes below are **release gates**, not an assertion that no partial implementation exists. Check an item only after source review and the relevant local/runtime validation.

### A. Screen Edge and connected surfaces — P0

- [ ] **Screen Edge exists both while idle and while a window is maximized.** It must not disappear simply because no maximized window is present.
- [ ] **Screen Edge width is configurable in Settings.** The setting must use one canonical configuration field, have a safe default/range and update the active edge without requiring an alternate renderer.
- [ ] **All connected popups use one shared connector width/thickness contract.** No popup should invent a narrower stem or a private gap value.
- [ ] **No visible gap between bar/Screen Edge and popup body.** Shared geometry must own seam overlap so fractional scaling, animation and antialiasing do not expose a slit.
- [ ] **Left and right Sidebars connect to the vertical Screen Edge**, not to the top bar or bottom screen edge.
- [ ] Connected surfaces behave correctly for top/bottom/left/right bar placement, transformed outputs and fractional scale.
- [ ] Reverse retract / hover bridge keeps the source and popup visually and interactively continuous during close/reopen transitions.

### B. Popup interaction correctness — P0

- [ ] Existing bar popups continue to use `modules/bar/StyledPopup.qml` and the shared connected-surface primitives.
- [ ] Popup placement anchors from the real visual source control / `hoverTarget`, not a loader or lifecycle wrapper.
- [ ] Keyboard focus, initial focus, Escape close and compositor focus-grab behavior remain correct.
- [ ] Outside-click close works without stealing input from transparent regions.
- [ ] Full-output click-catchers are owned by the same output as their popup on multi-monitor setups.
- [ ] Tray menu delayed-close logic cannot release the focus/grab of a newer active tray menu.
- [ ] No guessed `PanelWindow.active` / `onActiveChanged` style APIs are introduced without verifying the current Quickshell API.

### C. Thinkfan + System Monitor — P0

- [ ] **Thinkfan UI is integrated into the existing System Monitor popup** instead of living as a separate standalone popup.
- [ ] **Thinkfan settings are exposed in Settings** in the appropriate system-monitor/thermal area.
- [ ] Reuse the existing Thinkfan helper/service path; do not create a duplicate fan-control backend.
- [ ] Unsupported/missing Thinkfan environments fail gracefully and do not break System Monitor or Settings loading.
- [ ] Fan status/control state stays synchronized between Settings and the System Monitor popup.

### D. Settings correctness — P0

- [ ] **Settings > Bar renders real content** and no longer presents an empty page.
- [ ] Bar settings expose only supported v1.0 behavior; retired Dock/Bar renderer switches must not reappear through routing.
- [ ] Settings page loading remains lazy/deferred enough to avoid large synchronous rebuilds.
- [ ] Screen Edge width and Thinkfan controls are reachable through the normal Settings navigation.
- [ ] No user-facing setting remains that points to a removed runtime with no effect.
- [ ] Global Theme UI exposes **Material only**; no removed theme can still be selected, previewed or routed through Settings.

### E. Media Popup equalizer — P0

- [ ] The bar-attached Media Popup renders the existing **CAVA -> `PlayerControl` -> `WaveVisualizer`** path instead of an empty visualizer input.
- [ ] Confirm the required CAVA runtime/package is present in the supported install/package paths, or document/install it where currently missing.
- [ ] Visualizer lifecycle is efficient: start only when needed, stop when unused, and survive pause/resume, player switching and popup close/reopen.
- [ ] MPRIS controls, seek, volume and keyboard behavior do not regress while the visualizer is active.

### F. Calendar / Weather v1.0 composition — P0

Adapt the useful part of the Serpantinum reference without copying its right-side weather presentation.

- [ ] **Left:** calendar/date presentation based on the Serpantinum reference.
- [ ] **Center:** large digital time plus the hourly weather arc/timeline concept from Serpantinum.
- [ ] **Right:** use Hadalis' existing detailed weather presentation/data, not Serpantinum's simplified right panel.
- [ ] Preserve Hadalis weather data/service ownership, units, refresh behavior, location/error states and Material theme behavior.
- [ ] Layout remains usable across supported screen sizes/scales and does not depend on hard-coded screenshot dimensions.

### G. Material-only Global Theme cleanup — P0

Material is the **single canonical Global Theme** for Hadalis 1.0.

- [ ] Remove every non-Material Global Theme option from Settings, menus, previews and any user-facing theme selector.
- [ ] Remove non-Material Global Theme runtime branches, loaders, delegates, theme registries and alternate token/palette routing that are no longer required by Material.
- [ ] Remove dead non-Material theme assets and imports when no active Material path or supported panel family consumes them.
- [ ] Remove or update stale tests, docs and configuration examples that imply multiple Global Themes remain supported.
- [ ] Normalize old persisted non-Material theme values to Material safely; do not resurrect an old renderer/theme only to honor a legacy value.
- [ ] Keep only the minimal migration compatibility needed to read an old value and resolve it to Material, then delete compatibility code that no current caller needs.
- [ ] Material must remain visually correct across Bar, Screen Edge, popups, Sidebars, Overview, Settings and Waffle after the cleanup.

### H. Full `iiPerimeter` runtime cleanup — P0

The broad `iiPerimeter` composition runtime and the shared connected-popup primitives are **not the same thing**.

- [ ] Audit every active consumer of the full `iiPerimeter` runtime, topology, adapters, cutover/fallback flags and configuration.
- [ ] If the full runtime no longer owns required v1.0 behavior, remove it completely: runtime wiring, dead settings, adapters, tests and stale docs.
- [ ] If a required active consumer still exists, reduce the runtime to that concrete responsibility and document why it remains.
- [ ] **Do not remove** `modules/common/perimeter/ConnectedSurface*` / `PerimeterTokens.qml` merely because the broader runtime is removed; those are shared primitives used by connected popups.
- [ ] No ordinary bar popup may depend on enabling a broad perimeter cutover.

### I. Legacy/compatibility cleanup — P1

- [ ] Remove active reads/routes for retired renderer/style families when they no longer serve migration compatibility.
- [ ] Keep compatibility shims only where a current supported caller still needs the type/config name.
- [ ] Do not restore retired Pill/Mascot runtime behavior, historical Dock renderer families, Orbit/workspace experiments, removed Global Themes or similar dead presentation systems.
- [ ] Old persisted values must degrade safely to the supported v1.0 behavior instead of resurrecting removed renderers or themes.
- [ ] Keep Waffle separate and supported.

## 4. Connected-surface architecture contract

The existing popup path remains authoritative:

```text
modules/bar/StyledPopup.qml
modules/common/perimeter/ConnectedSurfaceGeometry.qml
modules/common/perimeter/ConnectedSurfaceConnector.qml
modules/common/perimeter/ConnectedSurfaceFrame.qml
modules/common/perimeter/ConnectedSurfaceContentHost.qml
modules/common/perimeter/ConnectedSurfaceMask.qml
modules/common/perimeter/PerimeterTokens.qml
```

Rules:

- `StyledPopup.qml` remains the entry point for existing bar popouts.
- Shared geometry/tokens own connector thickness, seam overlap, corner ownership and attachment behavior.
- Consumers provide content and source ownership; they should not duplicate connector geometry.
- Keep source-aware placement and shaped input regions.
- Preserve top/bottom/left/right attachment and output ownership.
- Fix shared geometry when the defect is systemic; do not paper over the same seam bug in every popup.

## 5. Required functionality that must not regress

- MPRIS player switching, play/pause, previous/next, seek and volume;
- CAVA / visualizer behavior where supported;
- keyboard navigation, initial focus and Escape close;
- click-outside close and transparent-region click-through semantics;
- hover-open / hover-transfer behavior;
- system tray and nested tray menus;
- Dock/task drag and reorder flows;
- Sidebar role routing, resize/edit behavior and open/close state;
- multi-output routing and source-screen ownership;
- fullscreen, lock, suspend/resume and compositor transitions;
- Niri primary behavior and existing Hyprland compatibility;
- Material theme tokens, palette and component rendering;
- Waffle family routing.

## 6. v1.0 hardening tasks — P1

- [ ] Audit every `StyledPopup` consumer for connector, anchor, focus and mask consistency.
- [ ] Test bottom-right and vertical-bar anchors explicitly; these expose clipping/placement errors easily.
- [ ] Remove fractional-scale seams and one-pixel antialiasing gaps without per-popup magic numbers.
- [ ] Confirm Settings remains responsive while visiting all heavy pages repeatedly.
- [ ] Confirm no `Type ... unavailable` failures through Sidebar Left/Right, Compact Sidebar, Overview, Waffle and Settings routes.
- [ ] Verify fullscreen transparent surfaces never land on the wrong output.
- [ ] Verify suspend/resume, lock/unlock and output hotplug do not leave stale popup/focus state.
- [ ] Audit packaging/runtime dependencies required by media visualization, Thinkfan and weather.
- [ ] Search the active tree for removed Global Theme names and eliminate live references outside intentional migration code/history.

## 7. Local release validation — P0 gate

The maintainer's local pass is authoritative. At minimum, validate the exact candidate SHA with:

```bash
bash scripts/validate-maintainer-local.sh
```

Then perform live desktop checks:

- [ ] Screen Edge visible when idle and maximized; width setting updates correctly.
- [ ] Connected popups from top, bottom, left and right positions have no visible gap and use a consistent connector width.
- [ ] Left/right Sidebars connect to the correct Screen Edge.
- [ ] Settings > Bar renders; Thinkfan and Screen Edge controls are reachable.
- [ ] System Monitor contains Thinkfan functionality and no duplicate Thinkfan popup remains in normal UX.
- [ ] Media Popup equalizer works through play/pause, player switch, close/reopen and keyboard open.
- [ ] Calendar/Weather composition matches the intended left/center structure while keeping Hadalis detailed weather on the right.
- [ ] Only **Material** is available as a Global Theme; an old persisted non-Material value resolves safely to Material.
- [ ] Material renders correctly across Bar, Screen Edge, popups, Sidebars, Overview, Settings and Waffle.
- [ ] Tray/context menus work on a non-primary output.
- [ ] Multi-monitor, fractional scaling, transformed outputs and vertical bars are usable.
- [ ] Niri full pass; Hyprland compatibility smoke test.
- [ ] Fullscreen, lock/unlock and suspend/resume do not leave broken shell surfaces.

## 8. v1.0 definition of done

Hadalis can be called **1.0** only when:

- every P0 release blocker above is completed and locally validated;
- no known empty/broken Settings route remains for supported features;
- connected surfaces visually read as one coherent bar/edge continuation, not detached cards;
- no required behavior depends on a dead/half-enabled renderer or undocumented migration path;
- **Material is the only active Global Theme**, with non-Material values removed from normal runtime/UI and legacy values safely normalized;
- the broad `iiPerimeter` runtime is either removed or retained only for a clearly documented active responsibility;
- media visualization, Thinkfan and weather dependencies are packaged/documented correctly;
- supported panel families, the Material theme and compositor targets pass the release smoke matrix;
- release notes / `CHANGELOG.md` describe user-visible 1.0 behavior after the implementation stabilizes.

## 9. Explicit non-goals for 1.0

Do not spend the 1.0 cycle on:

- a new popup framework parallel to `StyledPopup`;
- reviving retired renderer/style experiments;
- rebuilding the old Pill or Mascot runtime;
- preserving or reintroducing multiple Global Theme families after the Material-only cleanup;
- copying Serpantinum's right-side weather panel;
- cosmetic documentation history that does not help implement or validate 1.0;
- hosted-CI cleanup while Actions usage is intentionally not part of the maintainer validation loop.

## 10. Documentation hygiene

To avoid future contradictions:

- keep this README focused on **current** v1.0 requirements, invariants and release gates;
- treat the Material-only Global Theme rule as canonical anywhere older documentation still describes multiple Global Themes;
- do not pin transient implementation status to old commit hashes here;
- put historical changes in `CHANGELOG.md` / Git history;
- when code removes a feature/runtime/theme, remove or update its user-facing setting and stale documentation in the same change where practical;
- when an older document conflicts with the newest maintainer instruction or this active v1.0 contract, update/remove the stale statement instead of maintaining two competing rules.

If the maintainer gives a newer explicit instruction, that instruction supersedes this document and this README should be refreshed to match it.
