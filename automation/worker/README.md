# Hadalis deterministic worker

The worker is the **hands**, never the brain. ChatGPT remains the only component that chooses commands, patches, goals, or next development steps.

## Job contract

ChatGPT publishes an explicit job at:

```text
automation/queue/pending/JOB-000001.json
```

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "JOB-000001",
  "base_sha": "<40-character dev HEAD before the job file is created>",
  "actions": [
    {
      "exec": {
        "argv": ["bash", "scripts/validate-maintainer-local.sh"],
        "cwd": ".",
        "timeout_seconds": 1800
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`base_sha` must equal the first parent of the commit that introduces the job file. This makes a stale or raced GitHub write fail closed instead of silently running against an unexpected repository state.

Serialize jobs with a JSON encoder and validate the resulting document before
publication. Shell quoting inside an argv string is not JSON escaping. An
invalid job consumes its ID and gets a terminal result without executing any
action. Corrected work requires a new ID. Once that result is published, the
original malformed input may move byte-for-byte to `automation/queue/archive/`
with an `.invalid.txt` suffix; retain its result and input digest.

The worker:

1. fetches `origin/dev`;
2. discovers pending job JSON files;
3. skips jobs that already have a result;
4. resolves the exact commit that introduced the job;
5. verifies its first parent against `base_sha`;
6. clones an isolated automation-owned workspace at that exact commit;
7. executes only the explicit `argv` arrays, never `shell=True`;
8. captures exit code/stdout/stderr with bounded output;
9. removes only its own temporary workspace;
10. publishes a result to `automation/results/JOB-000001.json` through a normal non-force push.

Execution uses a private fsynced job/action ledger under
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/hadalis-automation/worker`. The supervisor admits at most two
jobs by default (`HADALIS_WORKER_CONCURRENCY`, bounded 1..4), with a separate
single publisher. Publication failure retries the saved result, never the
commands. Stable job IDs are execution tombstones; do not reuse an ID for a
different job. Recovery reports an interrupted external action as
`indeterminate`, with `recovery_required`, instead of guessing its outcome.
Pool health clears a Git discovery error only after a successful discovery
cycle; that recovery does not erase a separate job metadata failure.

Jobs may name `profile_id` and up to eight `resources` (for example
`shell:inir`). Only equal resource names serialize. Each command has bounded
pipe capture, process-group cancellation, CPU/address-space limits and a
parent-death guard. Startup terminates identified orphan groups, reconstructs
completed receipts and cleans private clones. Completed evidence expires after
14 days; execution tombstones stay. A 256 MiB evidence admission limit prevents
unbounded collection. Cancellation is a durable file in `worker/cancellations`
named by job ID, written by the control frontend.

An action can collect evidence without Quickshell:

```json
{"diagnostics":{"checks":["services","processes","journal","git","resources","runtime"],"lines":100}}
```

Supported checks also include hardware, crashes, config and one private
screenshot. Config reads are restricted to compositor/shell/Automation paths;
credential paths are denied. Capture, journal history, commands and observation
time are bounded. Evidence IDs, source SHA and timestamps identify every action.
Raw stdout, journals, configuration and screenshots remain private (0700/0600).
Git results use a strict metadata allowlist, not heuristic log redaction.
The managed chat can receive structured error codes and status metrics with
provenance; it must cite the evidence supporting each debugging conclusion.

Administrator steps are typed, never arbitrary root argv:
`{"privileged":{"operation":"system-service-status","unit":"example.service","reason":"Inspect the observed service failure"}}`.
`system-service-restart` is also supported. The separate broker defaults to an
empty unit allowlist. Set `units` and `authentication` (`sudo-cache` or `polkit`)
in private `~/.config/hadalis/automation-privilege.json`. Authenticate with the
OS agent or an existing sudo cache. No password is accepted by Settings, jobs,
IPC, configuration or logs. The root command is a fixed systemctl operation
with an elevated timeout; restarts submit a systemd transaction without waiting
indefinitely. A durable private audit deduplicates each job/action key. An
uncertain broker outcome requires evidence reconciliation, not automatic retry.

Risky shell changes use `shell_deploy` with `family` (`inir` or `waffle`), up to
64 relative QML/JS/JSON `files`, and a `reason`. A bounded staging copy runs the
canonical validator and syntax checks before file replacement. Deployment
requires a running known-good shell, private backups, a durable apply journal
and 30 seconds of crash observation. The backend restores an interrupted apply
after a runner crash/reboot. Concurrent target changes are retained as a
recovery conflict. A failed canonical check prevents deployment. Recovery can
start one named user shell service per family; it never depends on QML staying
alive. This path validates startup/crash behavior, not complete desktop UX.

## Safety boundaries

- No hard reset, clean, force push, or shared-history rebase.
- The maintainer worktree is never checked out, reset, or cleaned by the worker.
- Command working directories must remain inside the isolated execution clone.
- Execution environment variables are allowlisted.
- Per-command timeouts and capture limits are enforced.
- One local daemon instance is enforced with a file lock under `XDG_STATE_HOME`.
- Publish races are handled by recloning current `dev` and retrying a normal push.

Run one discovery/execution cycle with:

```bash
python automation/worker/daemon.py --once
```

Run continuously with:

```bash
python automation/worker/daemon.py
```
