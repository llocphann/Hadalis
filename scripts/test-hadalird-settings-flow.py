"""Guard the QML layout contract that lets Settings page 38 load.

Qt Quick Flow's implicitHeight is a read-only, layout-computed property.
Assigning it fails QML component creation before the page can be shown.
This source-scope guard runs in CI when the native Niri/QML host is absent;
live SettingsPageHost instantiation remains the separate native acceptance.
