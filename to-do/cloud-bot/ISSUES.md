# Issues/bugs — fix first

Consolidated on 2026-10-10 from the [former task ledgers](../../docs/archive/chatbot/2026-10-10/README.md).
Open items include remaining acceptance of source fixes; they do not all mean
that implementation is missing. Refetch current `dev` before diagnosing.

## Current failures and owner reports

- [x] **P0 — fullscreen window retains hidden Screen Edges/Panel/Perimeter after switching to another window (owner report 2026-10-10):**
  Reproduce on Niri: fullscreen client A, then open/focus window B in the
  same active workspace. Screen Edges, Abyss Panel and Perimeter reportedly
  disappear even though B is the foreground normal window. Source diagnosis:
  `GameMode.hasFullscreenOnOutput()` currently treats ANY fullscreen-sized
  window on an active workspace as if it still visually covers that output,
  ignoring `workspace.active_window_id`. Niri explicitly keeps fullscreen
  windows as ordinary scrolling-layout participants, so focusing another
  window does not necessarily revoke A's fullscreen geometry. Shared gate
  drives `AbyssPerimeter.presented`, ScreenEdges frame updates, ScreenCorners,
  Sidebar and other output surfaces. Independently,
  `NiriService.handleWorkspaceActiveWindowChanged()` and
  `handleWindowFocusChanged()` compare an object key (string) to a Niri
  workspace ID (number) with `===`, potentially discarding active-window
  selection updates needed to repair this gate.
  Investigate/fix with output-local selected-window semantics and numeric-ID
  normalization, preserve actual fullscreen suppression, multi-monitor
  isolation and mapped-window/stacking ownership. Test focus A→B→A,
  second monitor, workspace switch, startup unknown selection. Do not
  change layer ordering, input masks, animation, focus or visual quality.
  **Source fix committed on dev, native acceptance still OPEN.**
  `47071303a50f26cee31a6a03aabf7297662d51f4` fixes numeric-vs-string
  workspace dictionary key comparisons in both NiriService
  active-window update handlers. `0129cb4ce8d3c81215387b0959f93f7708f5c028`
  changes GameMode's per-output fullscreen coverage to select only
  `workspace.active_window_id` (normalized as strings); while no active
  ID is reported, it falls back to the focused window or the sole
  unambiguous workspace window. Global visible-fullscreen/GameMode now
  delegates to the same foreground-aware predicate. No layer-shell,
  native input region, rendering, hover or animation logic was edited.
  This matches Niri's documented scrolling-layout fullscreen behavior
  (https://github.com/niri-wm/niri/wiki/Fullscreen-and-Maximize).
  A permanent direct-source behavior regression
  `scripts/test-niri-fullscreen-selection.mjs` was added in
  `b1b565e926d235a11f9443e9adc1f8a72ca468b1` and integrated
  with the canonical `scripts/validate-maintainer-local.sh`
  in `da3a9bf3086d8da6b0ee519015601f059871dc5c`.
  An independent isolated V8 run of the exact recorded test logic
  against the newly committed QML functions passed 14/14 assertions,
  including numeric Niri IPC workspace event updates and focus
  A(fullscreen)→B(normal)→A. The native Niri compositor scenario and
  full maintainer validation have NOT been run on this code here.
  Next: sync `dev` into the installed iNiR runtime via
  `./setup update --local` and restart, then reproduce on the
  same workspace; assert Screen Edges/Panel/Perimeter return for B,
  hide under A fullscreen, recover when A exits, remain correct
  on a second output, and don't regress popup hover/lifecycle.
  If still failing, capture Niri workspaces/windows and
  `abyssHoverProbe.snapshot` with exact running source identity.
  **Owner accepted on 2026-10-10: fullscreen switch regression is fixed.**
  Preserve the fix and the 14/14 focused source assertions.
  Note that the separately supplied 17:06 diagnostic archive reports
  an earlier checkout SHA (`418fcd9e`) and cannot by itself identify
  the exact running fix revision; owner's explicit functional
  acceptance is the basis for checking off this task. Archive after
  the normal seven-day retention window.

- [ ] **Notification Center post-notification Popup has wrong size/placement and lags — owner report 2026-10-10 21:55 ICT:**
  **Owner follow-up 2026-10-10: normal post-alert Center sizing is now OK;
  stopping screen recording and receiving the `Recording saved` notification
  still makes the transient popup lag.** This is a narrower unresolved
  case, not evidence the prior toast-to-Center separation regressed.
  Concrete path: `scripts/videos/record.sh` calls
  `notify-send "Recording saved" "${SAVE_PATH%/}/$output_name" -a Recorder`
  after the recording file is finalized, and
  `AbyssNotificationsContent.qml` previously published the transient
  `NotificationListView.contentHeight` directly. Long path cards may need
  multiple delegate/layout passes, driving repeated body requests while
  the recording indicator disappears and popup reveal starts.
  Causality of native frame pacing is **not proven**.

  Source-level refinement on `dev`:
  `98d0b387881c1d94b75dff5a78aee312bf830da5`
  batches positive ListView measurements through an on-demand 75ms
  Timer and publishes settledPopupHeight/popupLayoutReady.
  `df86dca7278f680d2c9d555c62ac7b1be8f9943e`
  enables `residentContent` while transient notifications are pending,
  measuring their card offscreen at the resting target size; only reveals
  the banner once popupLayoutReady. No new background timer,
  global mouse grab, visual quality reduction or change to the
  dedicated NotificationCenterPopup. A source-executed regression,
  `a57020f20da369baf8db183a2164cb1dbc1cc927`, verifies
  zero/provisional/measured/new-notification states and multiple
  banner/Center cases: **46/46** isolated JavaScript assertions PASS.
  This is NOT native Qt frame/presentation evidence; on-Niri recording
  stop/new-notification acceptance remains OPEN. Update the common
  technical investigation in
  [Notification post-alert geometry and recording-stop lag](../../docs/abyss/NOTIFICATION_CENTER_POST_ALERT_GEOMETRY_LAG_2026-10-10.md).

  **SOURCE-LEVEL FIX IMPLEMENTED on dev (2026-10-10); Niri acceptance OPEN.**
  The earlier native video exposed a tall right-edge notification surface
  morphing into a much smaller bottom-right Popup while a new alert was
  still present. The confirmed source-level conflict was the older
  `AbyssPerimeter.qml` transient `notification` host:
  `centerOnOutput` switched its presentationKind, edge, contentKind
  and measured contentHeight to a nearly full-screen `center` layout
  immediately when `GlobalStates.notificationCenterOpen` became true,
  even though the very same event requested this host to CLOSE and
  `AbyssBodyHost.visualResident` kept its closing animation alive.
  Source change `6f0321dec1c688d25cddcd5728ee0f2a2276f8b0`
  fixes the role conflict: the transient host now ALWAYS uses
  `presentationKind: "notifications"` and `contentKind: "popup"`,
  with independent toast-only dimensions/edge/along/obstacles;
  `!GlobalStates.notificationCenterOpen` still causes its normal
  semantic close. The dedicated NotificationCenterPopup remains the
  sole history Popup. `98415d0c43d3145920265f8f6ccdccdf79368273`
  enables stable-size toast content behind its existing reveal clip
  rather than resizing/reflowing the content with that clip.
  This removes a concrete source of extra Loader construction,
  history markAllRead coupling, a wrong-height transition and layout
  churn. It does NOT establish a native end-to-end FPS improvement.
  `scripts/test-abyss-notification-transition.mjs` runs exact
  committed QML expressions against the fresh-alert → Center-open
  transition, top/bottom placement, multiple/empty notifications,
  customized Center sizes and separate dedicated host: **32/32 PASS**
  in an isolated JS environment. Registered in
  `scripts/validate-maintainer-local.sh`. Full validator / Niri
  test and owner acceptance remain PENDING. **Keep issue OPEN**;
  next owner action: sync dev, install QML, reproduce the 21:55
  recording steps, confirm tall sidebar never appears, observe
  layout stability AND whether perceived animation lag has ended.
  Preserve the separately reverted hover/bridge work.
  **Original video and independent bug report:** Owner video
  `2026-10-10_21.55.09.mp4` (1920×1200, 30fps, ~8.73s,
  shared in ChatGPT, NOT a repository file) shows a recent notification
  toast (~0.7–1.5s), followed by a connected right-hand Notification
  Center opening with an abnormally tall/narrow silhouette
  (~1.7–2.5s), changing apparent size/attachment around
  ~2.7–2.9s, then appearing as a much shorter bottom-right
  Notifications/Activity tabbed Popup (~2.9–4.1s). The change is
  visually observable; exact frame timing, compositor involvement,
  configured dimensions and causality are **NOT** yet measured.
  This is distinct from the existing premature hover/bridge dismissal.
  Repository source offers plausible investigation sites only:
  `NotificationCenterPopup.qml` fixed requested implicit dimensions,
  `AbyssPerimeter.qml` hosted popup span/depth/edge/join,
  `AbyssBodyHost.qml` animation and retained/visual placement,
  `AbyssBodyPlacement.js` allocator shrink/stack and
  `AbyssGeometry.js` corner joins. Do not declare any of
  these the cause without an actual native before/after trace.
  **Technical analysis, video timeline, read-only native measurement
  requirements and acceptance:**
  [Notification Center post-alert sizing/lag investigation](../../docs/abyss/NOTIFICATION_CENTER_POST_ALERT_GEOMETRY_LAG_2026-10-10.md).
  Runtime source patch is committed; keep OPEN until exact-SHA Niri capture,
  controlled no-notification/with-notification reproduction,
  verified initial/resting size and owner acceptance.

- [ ] **Popup/Edgebar closes while hovered — received/updated 2026-10-10:**
  **Owner update, 2026-10-10 evening — LOCAL DESKTOP CHATBOT NEXT:**
  The owner retested TWO successive cloud hover/bridge fixes and explicitly
  reported **no improvement** (latest video: `2026-10-10_21.21.26.mp4`,
  supplied in the chat, not tracked in Git). At the owner's request,
  ALL runtime QML/JS, test and validation changes from the attempts were
  reverted exactly to pre-experiment commit
  `a7e76b509075ba1a3f2bc9d0c16b6a5e76672ba1`, with original source
  blob SHAs verified and no runtime/test diff at final revert
  `eb3f9d35133e41e7ad343b94c74671fc7fe5e9ac`.
  **Do not reuse** either rejected approach or claim the green 42/42 and
  31/31 source expression tests proved native pointer correctness.
  The local chatbot must investigate with real Niri/Quickshell pointer
  event/input-mask and semantic lifetime evidence before making a fix.
  **Complete technical notes, precise reproduction and acceptance:**
  [Popup–Screen Edge native hover investigation](../../docs/abyss/POPUP_EDGE_HOVER_UNRESOLVED_2026-10-10.md).
  Status **OPEN**, owner acceptance pending; no new runtime patch authorized
  by this revert/documentation action.
  NEW OWNER REPRO 2026-10-10: moving the pointer across the gap/connection
  between a Popup and its Screen Edge still loses hover/focus and automatically
  dismisses the Popup. Owner supplied `2026-10-10_13.34.50.mp4` (31.93 s,
  1920x1200, ~30 fps) in the conversation, showing multiple edge-attached
  panels; the clip is not independently frame-timing evidence or an attached
  repo fixture. Do not count the previous probe correction as a product fix.
  Preserve native/Qt pointer focus and hover separately from keyboard focus;
  require deliberate pointer transfer (physical frame → connector → body),
  sustained dwell, fast reversal, all four edges, generic and StyledPopup,
  Bar auto-hide leases and click-through to blank workspace.
  body and painted Screen Edge connections must retain hover. Pushed source
  `10311cd96892d86d86870d327d28b27e32df8fbd` repairs padding/interactive-child
  hover and coalesces Bar hold publication; its focused four-edge checks passed.
  A further composite-mask candidate for SDF shoulders, physical Edge bridges,
  source-module pointer priority and Recording input is saved **WIP / HOLD** in
  this stop checkpoint. Final shoulder geometry, Clock/Weather (1,156 samples),
  cold mount and Recording fixtures pass; final generic/mature hover fixture
  **FAILS** at left bridge x=14,y=200. That point overlaps the source anchor;
  inspect actual requested/anchor/body leases before deciding whether this is a
  probe error or runtime dismissal. Cloud continuation on 2026-10-10 committed
  test-only qualification change `c499fb3ecdb07250c710bac82f483272c42e46c2`:
  `scripts/test-popup-anchor-hover-runtime.py` now searches SDF-painted
  bridge pixels outside both source input regions and content, asserts the
  resulting point belongs to the native/hover footprint, and preserves all
  four edges, Bar leases and 900ms dwell. This removes one ambiguous oracle;
  **runtime NOT RUN, result UNKNOWN**, and no source runtime fix or product
  acceptance is claimed. Next: execute the corrected fixture on this exact
  commit with a stable private output, inspect requested/anchor/body leases
  if it fails, then run geometry/Weather/cold/Recording checks sequentially.
  Resolve failures before exact-SHA canonical clean-clone validation. Do not
  weaken all-edge dwell/input tests. Owner cold/normal hover, connected input,
  click-through and multi-output acceptance remain separate.
  Serial local validation order (preserve full logs, actual exit codes and exact
  source SHA): `python3 scripts/test-abyss-geometry-contract.py`,
  `python3 scripts/test-popup-anchor-hover-runtime.py`,
  `python3 scripts/test-popup-cold-start-lifecycle-runtime.py`,
  `python3 scripts/test-weather-popup-handoff-runtime.py`, then
  `python3 scripts/test-recording-abyss-runtime.py`. Stop on a real failure
  and diagnose rather than interpreting older PASS logs as new results.
  Once focused failures are resolved, execute
  `bash scripts/validate-maintainer-local.sh` on a clean exact-SHA checkout;
  then request independent owner desktop/multi-output acceptance.
  [Durable receipt and logs](../../docs/evidence/abyss-product/20261010-hover-checkpoint/README.md).
  The earlier maintainer stop/save/push was honored at the checkpoint.
  **NEW source candidate 2026-10-10:** `6c10387d18aa1793d7ad2f2ef20eb37020d69abf`
  extends only the popup's tangent-bounded painted input to the physical
  Screen Edge (previously stopped at its inner seam); no output-wide mask.
  It also coalesces exactly adjacent equal-span SDF strips to reduce live
  Region/Instantiator churn while retaining every covered input pixel.
  Contract additions: `38437f56` (physical seam/strict SDF occupancy) and
  `5a2cb977` (four-edge physical rim → connector → content and reverse,
  sustained 900ms, generic/StyledPopup, Bar lease, click-through, focus).
  Offline V8 execution of the repository geometry test body passed
  **504,005 assertions**, source/test blob SHAs `3d6953ae`/`372ff060`,
  with equivalent assertion and readFile stubs; 576 independent strip-union
  comparisons showed identical occupied pixels. **This is not a Qt/Quickshell
  run; runtime, exact-SHA canonical and owner session are NOT VALIDATED.**
  Next: perform the serial native commands above at fresh HEAD, preserve
  focus/lease/Region evidence on any failure, compare owner hover behavior,
  then canonical and physical multi-output acceptance. Keep issue OPEN.

  **OWNER REGRESSION RECONFIRMED 2026-10-10 (current continuation):** after
  `6c10387` and its tests, Popup still loses hover/auto-closes while crossing
  the connector, and Abyss Panel still lags. Therefore that runtime fix is
  **INEFFECTIVE / NOT ACCEPTED**, irrespective of offline 504,005 assertions;
  those assertions only proved geometry, not compositor pointer delivery.
  Dedicated non-force revert `0d26291646bc9b4db6f0678c54b10f7a4b8c8962`
  restored `AbyssGeometry.js`, the geometry test and hover runtime fixture
  to `e6d220e` source without rewriting prior history. DO NOT reinstate the
  physical outer-edge hitbox extension or Region coalescing unchanged.
  A distinct read-only diagnosis `9c6366ee5d3557a98940637dad80b667b71bc4f0`
  expands existing `abyssHoverProbe.snapshot()` with each mature popup's
  requested/semantic/linger state, source-vs-body hover, input mask registration,
  strip count and geometry; generic popup state is also captured. No automatic
  remap, global hover padding, timer delay or input interception was added.
  `abyssHoverProbe.refreshMask/swapMask/remapWindow` remain explicit bounded
  diagnostic experiments; **do not apply them automatically**. Compare
  snapshots with the installed exact source SHA during a genuine failed
  crossing: distinguish compositor mask not delivering events, source hover
  priority, and semantic timer expiry before changing input routing. Neither
  old focused PASS nor an IPC snapshot alone is physical mouse acceptance.
  Serial native fixture and canonical results on current SHA are NOT RUN;
  preserve source/device and before/after receipts.

  **Diagnostic failure received 2026-10-10, 07:18:55 UTC:** owner uploaded
  `identity.txt` and `frame-start.txt` from collector first run. Checkout
  `dev` was `ff56015cf43b16580f0373881e8471984d9633bc`;
  `qs=/usr/bin/qs`, original `qs_config=auto`. Error:
  `Could not find "default" config directory or shell.qml in any valid config path.`
  This is the diagnostic **NOT STARTED**: neither frame intervals nor pointer
  lease samples were collected; it proves neither a product bug cause nor a
  product fix. Existing `scripts/inir` explicitly targets a running config
  through `qs -p "$config_dir" ipc call`; old collector lacked `-p`.
  Corrected collector `4dc295e7f118a2445ca5ab4d6a66de2552312532`
  selects an active iNiR instance, or an explicitly provided path, and records
  installed-QML-vs-checkout match flags without starting/restarting shell.
  The corrected collector has NOT been run on the owner's desktop. Repeat
  after pulling latest `dev`; if methods are absent inspect the installed
  vs checkout flags, never treat a matching Git checkout SHA alone as proof
  that the running shell has been updated. Preserve actual command failure
  receipts and resume native hover/canonical acceptance only with live evidence.

  **2026-10-10 collector Bash syntax regression and resolution:** the next
  owner run failed at line 32 (`syntax error near unexpected token '|'`)
  because the text-mode `qs list --all` process substitution placed a pipe
  on the following line without ending the previous line with a pipe.
  A first attempted in-place fix `10a6604` was ALSO invalid: JavaScript
  replacement expanded the `$'` sequence inside `'/shell\\.qml$'` and
  duplicated the script tail. DO NOT use that commit. Final fix
  `9ba0204b4e2254393c8518526e9ddf6496b6769d` restored the exact
  840c00d source and replaced the bad pipeline without JS substitution
  expansion. Final Git blob `12dd8dd22d521f5be9312d17580c97ef7e46f780`
  was reproduced byte-for-byte in a local test environment:
  `bash -n` **exit 0** and a mocked active `qs -p` IPC sequence completed
  `startFrames`, `stopFrames`, exactly 40 `snapshot` calls, **exit 0**.
  These checks validate collector syntax and control flow only; they are
  NOT a Quickshell/Niri live test and do not close the popup/lag issues.
  Next: owner reruns after `git pull --ff-only` and supplies new receipts.

  For a read-only owner
  capture after installing the exact `dev` source, run
  `bash scripts/collect-abyss-hover-frames.sh`: 6 seconds of bounded
  frame-swapped intervals, followed by 40 at-most-150ms-apart requested
  IPC hover snapshots, each with a timestamp and actual errors preserved.
  Reproduce opening/reversal during the first phase, the source→bridge→body
  hover loss during the second. Owner now supplies **one**
  `hadalis-abyss-hover-*.tar.gz` archive rather than three separate files.
  Archive contains the original `identity.txt`, `frame-start.txt`,
  `frame-intervals.txt`, `hover-snapshots.log` and `run-result.txt`
  (on early failure, only the evidence files already produced).
  `15f5abbb1bc19bf5377636dbee03c7f973713330` adds a bounded
  exit-handler archive on both success and nonzero IPC exits; final Git
  blob `defb45271438a80cc012d611467ce6c9451f264a` passed actual
  `bash -n` exit 0 and fake `qs -p` full 40-snapshot test (exit 0)
  plus simulated failing `startFrames` (exit 1 and valid partial archive).
  This is script/mock validation, NOT production hover acceptance.

  **Real owner capture 2026-10-10 at 07:49:30Z**, checkout
  `8fd0db31006096f738dd8a4b527a009e10649558`, on Niri
  single eDP-1 output: Quickshell config resolved to
  `/home/llocphann/.config/quickshell/inir`, installed shell,
  AbyssPerimeter and AbyssGeometry file comparisons all MATCH, 40/40
  snapshot IPC calls succeeded. However **all 40 snapshots are idle**:
  `liquidPopupsOpen=false`, generic popup resident=false,
  0 mature popup slots active, Bar hover/hold=false and no module
  hovered. Therefore this trace does NOT capture a crossing or show
  why hover is lost. To reproduce next time: when script prints
  `PHASE 2/2`, OPEN the target Popup and cross its visible connector
  during the ~7 seconds. If still all idle, investigate event/mask
  delivery separately; do not assert a closed popup is an observed
  dismissal. A checkout Git SHA alone does not verify loaded shell
  identity. The helper never remaps/refreshes the mask or changes
  configuration. **Popup hover acceptance remains OPEN.**

  **Owner archive 2026-10-10 08:04:04Z (local 15:04):**
  `hadalis-abyss-hover-20261010-150404.tar.gz` contains
  `collector_exit_status=0`, but `frame-start.txt` is actually
  `Target not found.`; `frame-intervals.txt` has `count=0`
  and all quantiles null. Checkout `dev` at
  `5896b425951a774f6b209d68b50616297f455a3c`;
  Quickshell runtime location:
  `/home/llocphann/.config/quickshell/inir`.
  The installed `shell.qml` and `AbyssGeometry.js` MATCH
  checkout, but **`AbyssPerimeter.qml` is DIFFERENT**. A
  restart without a setup sync did not put the newest QML in
  the live installed runtime. The 40 snapshot IPC responses
  were successful but all had no active Popup or module hover
  (`liquidPopupsOpen=false`, empty popup slots); not a captured
  source→connector crossing. The old collector trusted an exit
  code 0 from missing target, a false positive diagnostic result.

  **Diagnostic guard fix `faf8ad59b9336ad6d2689b20ace52b28f22a6d45`:**
  fail closed if installed `shell.qml`, `AbyssPerimeter.qml`
  or `AbyssGeometry.js` differ from checkout (exit 4);
  require actual `"started":true` IPC response even if
  `qs` exits 0 with `Target not found.` (exit 5);
  require frame-summary signature (exit 6); reject invalid
  Abyss snapshots (exit 2). Preserve original exit code and
  raw receipts in one automatic `.tar.gz`, including failures.
  **Exact committed script Git blob
  `d4f52cef9342defc1fde61d1c4dfacdd67ff4f54`** was
  byte-matched by local `git hash-object`, and passed real
  `bash -n` exit 0 and five deterministic fake-IPC cases:
  missing handler 5, malformed stop 6, malformed snapshot 2,
  valid 40 snapshots 0, stale installed QML 4. Each generated
  one valid evidence archive. No new real Niri hover test on
  this corrected SHA. From checkout run the repository-supported
  `./setup update --local`, then `inir restart`, then collector
  (supported local-sync mode skips git pull and preserves dev tracking;
  full setup still performs its managed backup/sync/validation tasks).
  This safer local-sync hint was added to the collector in
  `5f7493ace0c4c3eee0f1f7e1bd7c75103a138b9a`;
  new exact blob `b19868ae8983bced8475b5133d44fddb89f0bbad`
  has `bash -n` exit 0 and differs from the five-case tested
  script only in this human-readable remediation text.
  Do not mutate installed runtime automatically from collector.
  Keep **Popup hover user acceptance OPEN**.

  **Owner archive 2026-10-10 08:26:41Z — now source MATCH, target MISSING:**
  The single `hadalis-abyss-hover-20261010-152641.tar.gz` contains
  `run-result.txt: collector_exit_status=5`,
  `frame-start.txt: Target not found.`,
  `diagnostic-error.txt` correctly refuses a successful frame probe.
  Checkout: `dev` at `3acf9685ce7aef5e1c7e879e2437a7001ac3f874`,
  running resolver: `/home/llocphann/.config/quickshell/inir`.
  Unlike the previous run, ALL THREE installed-vs-checkout source
  comparisons `shell.qml`, `AbyssPerimeter.qml` and `AbyssGeometry.js`
  now **MATCH**. This means the installed files match the checkout,
  but it does NOT establish that the active QML tree has constructed
  `AbyssPerimeter.qml` or that its IPC handler is registered.
  There are NO frame intervals and NO hover samples in this bundle;
  do NOT infer a popup dismiss cause from these absences.

  Source review on `dev`:
  `shell.qml` activates `ShellAbyssCriticalPanels.qml` only under
  `activePanelFamily=abyss` and familyMountReady; within that critical
  host the `AbyssPerimeter.qml` LazyLoader additionally requires
  `Config.ready`, deferred readiness, `enabledPanels` containing
  `abyssPerimeter`, and no diagnostic unmount. The handler
  `abyssHoverProbe` lives INSIDE that optional Perimeter. Therefore
  candidate explanations for `Target not found.` include the
  relevant family/host/Perimeter not being mounted, or a stale/failed
  live engine instance. None are yet proven by the archive.
  Distinguish them using registry and critical-host state before
  changing lifecycle or hit regions. Quickshell documents the
  read-only `qs ipc show` target/function enumeration.

  **Collector evidence expansion
  `5462432e442048be32bf7de8e1227b892ed86e93`:**
  capture `ipc-targets.txt` from `qs -p CONFIG ipc show`,
  `abyss-host-status.txt` from existing read-only
  `abyssHostProbe status`, `hover-preflight.txt` from
  `abyssHoverProbe snapshot`, plus per-probe process statuses,
  in the SAME one-file archive before `startFrames`. Keep
  fail-closed `startFrames` recognition and now reject a
  `stopFrames` result with count=0 as non-evidence (exit 6).
  Script does NOT remount or reconfigure the desktop.
  This candidate's native run is PENDING; status remains OPEN.

  **Owner archive 2026-10-10 09:28:01Z (16:28 local), exact
  checkout `a5ebffa747ddead7799d6dd6501f712996e068bf`:**
  `hadalis-abyss-hover-20261010-162800.tar.gz` was inspected
  without extracting archive paths to disk. Contains a valid
  `collector_exit_status=0`, installed/checkout parity MATCH
  for `shell.qml`, `AbyssPerimeter.qml`, `AbyssGeometry.js`,
  live IPC registry `target abyssHoverProbe` with
  `startFrames`, `stopFrames`, `snapshot`; all 3 preflight
  CLI status values 0. `abyssHostProbe.status()` returned:
  family abyss, perimeterLoaded/perimeterActive true,
  deferredPanelsReady=true, nativeFirstFramesReady=true,
  coldRecreated=true. Thus the prior `Target not found.`
  obstruction **is NOT present in this capture**.

  40 valid hover snapshots for output `eDP-1`; samples 00–34
  show no popup. Exactly samples 35–39 show an OPEN
  `notificationCenter` popup in slot 0. At #35 and #36 its
  input bounds grow from width ~0.012 to ~123.68px; #37
  width 420px and anchorHover=true. #38 (09:28:18.946Z)
  anchorHover=false but contentHover=true, establishing
  a pointer-reachable content phase. #39
  (09:28:19.186Z) anchorHover=false and contentHover=false,
  bodyHover=false, yet `requestedVisible=true`,
  `lingerVisible=true`, `hosted=true`,
  `nativeRegionRegistered=true`, `bodyReady=true`,
  `bodyAcceptsInput=true` and input width still 420px.
  `semanticHold=false` all five slots; `barPopupHoverLease`
  is false by design for NotificationCenter
  (`barAutoHideHoldEnabled: false`), NOT a lost Bar lease.
  There is **no popup dismissal observed**, because the
  original 40-snapshot window ends immediately after #39.
  Neither a true source→connector failure nor a fix is
  established by this trace. Avoid interpreting the final
  all-false hover state alone as a confirmed bug.

  **Targeted follow-up on `dev`:**
  collector `d642cce966aea969a7f843180db82bece38e970a`
  extends the bounded hover phase to 100 snapshots,
  adds `popup_seen_during_capture` and
  `popup_open_to_closed_transition_observed` markers in
  `identity.txt`, and still archives everything in one
  `.tar.gz` (a missing popup emits a warning).
  Read-only `AbyssPerimeter.qml` snapshot addition
  `1a0875d1b0fdd9c7f572d96e1a6e1d3c6cd90c00`
  exposes `humanVisibleRequest`, `rawVisibleRequest`,
  `hoverActivates` and NotificationCenter's
  `anchorHovered`, `entryBridgeHeld`, `exitGraceHeld`,
  `hoverLeaseRequested`, `hoverSessionArmed`,
  `hoverAllowed`, `explicitForThisOutput`. No hitbox,
  focus, lease duration, animation or dismissal behavior
  was modified. This requires managed local installation
  sync of new QML before a live owner rerun; the additions
  have only source-level checks, NOT native validation.
  If later samples show an unexpected closure, correlate
  the two grace timers and semantic source state before
  attempting a causal geometry workaround.
  **Popup defect acceptance remains OPEN.**

  `abyssHoverProbe.snapshot` and `startFrames` both printed
  `Target not found.` with CLI exit status 0. Therefore the
  optional Perimeter handler had NOT been registered when
  this one snapshot was taken; its absence is directly explained
  by the deferred/initial-mount gating in
  `shell.qml` and `ShellAbyssCriticalPanels.qml`.
  A single sample does NOT prove whether loading was merely
  delayed (e.g. immediately after shell restart) or permanently
  stalled. There are NO hover or frame samples in this archive.
  Popup loss and frame lag remain unmeasured by this run.

  **Collector hardening `5bab2c774df7e2ecb5c0a446e3053a981323b1cd`:**
  after on-disk parity check, poll `abyssHostProbe.status`
  and `abyssHoverProbe.snapshot` at 250ms intervals for
  no more than 25s until Abyss, deferred readiness, active
  loaded Perimeter, first frame, complete cold re-create
  and at least one ready output are confirmed. Log every
  result to `readiness-trace.log` and final host/preflight
  payloads to the SAME automatic one-file `.tar.gz`.
  Give distinct exit 7 and archive evidence on timeout.
  Collector never mutates input regions, remounts QML,
  disables rendering or restarts the shell.
  **Native readiness, real source→connector→popup passage,

  ready, perimeter loaded/active, coldRecreated=true,

  `started=true`, and 100/100 IPC hover snapshots parsed.
  `identity.txt` reported popup_seen=1,
  popup_open_to_closed_transition_observed=1.
  Inspecting all samples reveals TWO full open→retract→closed
  cycles for **notificationCenter** (NOT generic Bar popup):
  #66–76 (~10:34:09.564–11.507Z; order 18) and #78–87
  (~10:34:11.882–13.597Z; order 19).
  The visible input region widened to 420 px at #68/#80
  (bounds x=1490..1910, y=616..1176 on eDP-1).
  `nativeRegionRegistered=true`, `bodyAcceptsInput=true`,
  `stripCount=62` while fully open. At #72/#83 the
  StyledPopup source `anchorHover` drops from true to false,
  without any sampled `bodyHover` or `contentHover`.
  At #73/#84 `requestedVisible=false`,
  `semanticHold=true`; at #74/#85 `stripCount=0`,
  `bounds.width=0`, `bodyAcceptsInput=false`.
  Popup slot vanishes at #76/#87. These prove hover-driven
  closure, NOT that the pointer physically remained over
  a painted connector (no pointer coordinates in archive).

  **Direct source/state contradiction observed and narrowly fixed:**
  At #68–71 and #80–82, `StyledPopup._anchorHover.hovered=true`,
  yet NotificationCenter `_anchorHovered=false` and
  `hoverLeaseRequested=false`. The latter tested only
  the specialized `anchorItem.containsMouse` flag (which
  ScreenCorners gates behind its dwell-ready MouseArea).
  Commit `96262edd788bf22fc69daaf4effe78a6384a2b38`
  now makes `NotificationCenterPopup._anchorHovered`
  include the existing actual source `HoverHandler`,
  preserving an active notification hover lease instead
  of letting its `entryBridgeHeld` time out beneath
  an observed hovered anchor. This leaves existing
  configured grace periods, placement, hit regions,
  input surface and animation unchanged.
  `scripts/test-notification-center-hover-lease.mjs`
  (`196d675e458cd65d4d24e5d073ecd9c1612c6ee4`)
  executes the actual source property expressions and
  passed 23/23 isolated JavaScript assertions; the
  canonical maintainer validator now runs it via
  `418c7de3ca406f160977e9c0dfcc387d478f3e8d`.
  Actual Niri regression proof and generic popup edge
  traversal remain PENDING. Next: sync updated
  `dev` QML via `./setup update --local`, restart,
  rerun bounded archive and retest corner-to-popup
  hover dwell without leaving the painted connector.
  Do not infer the correction addresses all edge/Bar
  popup families or mark acceptance complete.

  collector exit=0, readiness attempt=4, all installed QML/JS
  comparisons MATCH, live Abyss Perimeter loaded and active,
  `startFrames` succeeded and 100/100 hover JSON snapshots valid.
  One sampled output `eDP-1`, only mature popup kind
  `notificationCenter`. There were **TWO** popup open/retract
  episodes (slot orders 2 and 3), despite the collector's
  boolean `popup_open_to_closed_transition_observed=1`:
  order 2 was live #67–75, lost source hover at #72 while
  neither body nor content received it; the new
  `NotificationCenter._anchorHovered` now matches its
  `StyledPopup.anchorHover` at #67–71 and its hover lease
  remains true in those same samples. #72–73 shows
  exitGraceHeld=true and requestedVisible=true, #74
  requestedVisible=false and inputBounds width=0.
  No mouse coordinates were captured, so this first
  episode cannot yet be called a spurious seam dismissal
  rather than genuine pointer departure.
  Order 3 was live #81–96: anchor hover true #81–85;
  **source→content transfer succeeded** at #86,
  `contentHover=true` and `hoverLeaseRequested=true`
  continuously #86–93 (~1.5 seconds). #94 reports all
  hover=false with exitGraceHeld=true; #95 begins retract
  after the grace (not unexpected unless the pointer stayed
  inside the painted connector). This is native evidence
  the earlier lease contradiction was repaired in the
  observed source-held phase, and that one genuine
  transfer works, NOT complete acceptance for all paths.
  Status remains OPEN pending held-pointer connector dwell,
  other Popup kinds and native regression confirmation.

  **Follow-up diagnostic precision, not a product fix:**
  `eb1be574f339fc5fb3661ca20a012dce4aa8544f`
  exposes the already-existing StyledPopup source
  HoverHandler's `scenePosition` ONLY while hovered.
  `6f51143c30ad9137608dc6fee361f49ba270b56e`
  does the same for the existing hosted popup content
  handler and records `anchorScenePoint` and
  `contentScenePoint` in `abyssHoverProbe.snapshot`.
  Qt's HandlerPoint resets coordinates when there is
  no pointer; both fields return null when unhovered.
  The corner source and Perimeter body are in DIFFERENT
  QQuickWindow coordinate systems: never treat these
  as global coordinates or proof of cursor location
  during a missed/cleared hover event. No new
  input handlers, region masks, leases, timers or
  popup rendering behavior were introduced.
  `02b26956c02a1d64466bd2d28afb230892cdadb6`
  corrects the collector's boolean-only popup cycle
  summary by adding counts while keeping the legacy
  observed flag. Reprocessing 17:44 showed opens
  at #67/#81 and closes at #76/#97: two full cycles.
  The focused diagnostic source/lease regression now
  includes the new pointer fields
  (`c0e02aa337f434d74253e317f7f306aaa6018ae5`),
  and **27/27** assertions PASS in an isolated
  JS execution of the committed source expressions.
  These are not Qt/Niri runtime tests. The new
  coordinate fields and generic-edge transfer still
  require native owner validation; issue remains OPEN.

  #15–29→30 (order 3), #47–59→60 (order 4),
  #70–77→78 (order 5), #82–89→90 (order 6).
  This was exactly counted by the corrected
  `popup_open_transition_count=4` and
  `popup_open_to_closed_transition_count=4`.
  Anchor→hosted Popup hover was explicitly observed
  in all four cycles; 3 cycles had sustained hosted
  hover (#20–21 and #23–26 in the first,
  #50–55 in second, #73 third, #85 fourth).
  Crucially, order 3 lost both source and hosted
  hover at #22 and regained hosted hover at #23;
  the `exitGraceHeld=true` bridge prevented retraction.
  A subsequent all-false interval #27→28 ended
  the visit. This is proof that the grace sometimes
  recovers a transient loss, not proof of full native
  connector continuity or a bug-caused final close.
  The existing scene-local source/host pointers reveal
  within-hover approach positions, e.g. order 3:
  source (1919,1199), hosted (1899.48,1199)
  → (1879.97,1187.29), absent at #22,
  regained (1856.55,1171.68). These positions
  belong to separate QQuickWindows (never claim global
  location or interpolate the missing point).
  During the open state input bounds reached
  x=1490,y=616,w=420,h=560 and stripCount=62,
  `nativeRegionRegistered=true`.
  No objective basis yet to widen the native
  input mask, increase hover grace, or alter SDF paint.

  **Focused diagnostic follow-up:**
  `d2db68cece00b95d06ec6915f51db94342c4d8da`
  adds snapshot-only `hoverGeometry`:
  actual joined/raw surface bounds, edge, insets and
  point coverage by host input rectangle, connection
  strips or excluded Bar source input; null when no
  hosted pointer. This is a per-QQuickWindow local
  hit test, NOT a global pointer tracker.
  `scripts/test-abyss-hover-geometry-probe.mjs`
  (`c36358b317ecea96d8c8d9ce834051e8eadcb056`)
  passed 13/13 pure source-equivalent JS assertions;
  `6cf1f3db8f7577c9bd7d3ba58bcb312b019752fc`
  registers it in canonical validation.
  Owner Niri acceptance and general Popup hover
  regression remain OPEN; no rendering/input behavior
  was changed to produce this probe.

  Six distinct `notificationCenter` opens:
  #6–19, #24–30, #34–45, #48–55, #59–66,
  and #70–99 (last still in flight when sampling
  ended). Five observed open→closed transitions;
  summary counters exactly `6` and `5`.

  New geometry data confirms the actual hosted
  HoverHandler receives pointer on the 62 native
  shoulder/connector strips OUTSIDE the rectangular
  body input: `pointHit.inShoulderStrip=true`,
  `inInputBounds=false`, source exclusion=false
  repeatedly (e.g. #14–16, #36–41 and #74–79).
  Raw surface x=1490,y=616,w=480,h=560;

  stable connector hover #74–79 at (1899.48,1195.09)
  then #80–97 shows continuous body-input hover
  (e.g. 1903.39,1175.58 up to 1907.29,1085.82).
  The bridge→body transition did NOT dismiss
  the Popup. At #98 the existing HandlerPoint was
  null, then #99 requestedVisible=false with
  semanticHold=true; physical cursor position once
  hover was lost is unknown. Earlier five dismissals
  likewise follow all-false hover plus grace expiry;
  none proves the pointer remained inside the
  rendered union at dismissal. Input-region geometry
  therefore cannot yet be identified as the defect.
  This source/record supports no widening of hitboxes,
  timers, SDF union or intrusive global pointer hooks.
  Generic Popup, each screen edge, actual painted-pixel
  parity and definitive user acceptance remain OPEN.

  #35 (1903.39,1191.19). In order 6, a transient
  complete hover loss at #36 was recovered at #37
  by the existing exitGraceHeld lease; then hosted
  `contentHover=true` continuously from #37 to #81
  (approximately 45 snapshots over ~10 seconds),
  with fully open input width 420px and
  `hoverLeaseRequested=true`. A sustained stationary
  point (1782.41,1167.78) at #48–79 retained the
  Popup; no spontaneous hover-driven dismissal while
  continuously hovered was observed. At #82–83 all
  hovered flags and scene point were absent, grace
  began, and #84 had requestedVisible=false.
  No global pointer coordinates on leave, so the
  closed episodes do NOT prove a hit-test hole.
  Connector-to-body and stable-body NotificationCenter
  subcase has positive repeated native evidence.
  Do NOT generalize to other popup types, corners,

  In #03–07, #15–16 and #29 the hovered
  `contentScenePoint` lies in an actual
  `inShoulderStrip=true` region while outside the
  main input rectangle, with native region registered.
  In #47 order 6 starts on the strip; #48–49 all
  hover flags false, held by exit grace; #50–56
  hosted content hover returns and is continuously
  valid inside `inInputBounds=true`, so the popup
  does not close at the gap. In order 7, #85 hovered
  strip→#86–91 body input→#92–93 source anchor→
  #94 shoulder strip, all with `requestedVisible=true`.
  This includes a successful reverse transit through
  the seam without premature popup retraction.
  #95 later loses all hover, #96 grace/semantic hold,
  #97 retracts, #98 slot released. No pointer
  coordinates exist after leave, so the final close
  cannot be labeled spurious. No evidence of
  input capture over the full workspace, either.
  Notification Center seam/body hover tests have
  strong positive native evidence; actual user
  acceptance, other Popup kinds/corners and
  unusual layout transitions remain OPEN.
  No change to input mask/shape/hover timers is

- [ ] **Canonical validation — updated 2026-10-10:** exact committed SHA
  `10311cd96892d86d86870d327d28b27e32df8fbd` finished **FAIL: 327 PASS, 8 FAIL,
  1 SKIP**. Failures: keyboard sizing, Dashboard Music, Dashboard warm readiness,
  Equalizer presentation, Weather handoff, Abyss editor, OSD and shared content.
  [Full logs and failure details](../../docs/evidence/abyss-product/20261010-hover-checkpoint/README.md)
  are preserved. The warm fixture had a 757x852 canvas; a larger private-Niri
  output probe is recorded, but not all failures are proven environment-only.
  No retry was run after the explicit stop. The checkpoint's WIP source was
  not part of this clean-clone run and has no canonical result. Next: resolve
  affected focused failures, then validate the exact new committed SHA.
  Earlier `8b2ed6f0a` FAIL 334/1/1 remains historical; `a349d1a0c` corrected its
  stale Settings Top expectation to Bottom with 65 native forward/reverse states.
  Current canonical passes that contract; owner Polkit/focus acceptance is open.
  A previous or focused PASS never closes the overall gate.

- [ ] **Notification Popup stutter on Notification Edgebar hover and Recording start — owner report 2026-10-10:**
  Two distinct triggers need independent reproductions: (1) while a
  Notification Popup is open, hovering its Notification Edgebar opens the
  attached surface and causes visible stutter; (2) clicking **Record** starts
  recording, presents a Notification Popup and causes visible stutter. Do not
  confuse recording **start** with the separately tracked **Recording saved**
  notification on recording **stop** above, or with the pointer-hover dismissal
  issue. Root cause is UNVERIFIED; do not assume geometry, Pyramid, rendering,
  recorder or notification ownership before tracing them.
  Next: on an exact-SHA installed Niri/Quickshell desktop capture Popup/Edgebar
  lifetime, hover and recorded-frame timestamps, p50/p95/p99/dropped frames,
  compositor/main-thread load, and comparison runs without notification/
  recording; test cold/warm transitions and rapid hover. Acceptance: both
  triggers are smooth with notifications and recording still functional and
  confirmed by the owner. Link: generalized presentation jank is tracked in
  [Rework](REWORK_OPTIMIZATION.md). State: OPEN, native evidence pending.

- [ ] **Detailed Weather Popup background does not follow theme — owner report 2026-10-10:**
  Several component/card backgrounds remain grey rather than adapting to the
  selected theme. Audit `modules/bar/weather/WeatherPopupContent.qml` and
  child theme bindings, including inherited/default backgrounds. Correct
  fixed-grey surfaces without flattening meaningful component hierarchy;
  verify light/dark, wallpaper color changes, open/reopen, readable contrast
  and Abyss connected presentation. State: OPEN; needs theme screenshots,
  source validation and owner acceptance.

- [ ] **Edit Abyss Layout Media IPC preview incorrectly shows Volume IPC — owner report 2026-10-10:**
  The editor presents the **Volume IPC** sample when **Media IPC** is selected.
  Trace IPC preview type-to-component routing and restore the proper Media IPC
  sample while retaining a correct Volume IPC preview and actual IPC behavior.
  Test horizontal/vertical layout, four Screen Edges, Cancel/Done and per-output
  save/reopen. State: OPEN; source diagnosis and native visual acceptance pending.

- [ ] **Music tab Results / Queue scroll and scrollbar missing — owner report 2026-10-10:**
  Result, Queue and potentially other affected Music tab lists do not scroll
  and show no scrollbar. Repair content height/viewport/event routing and
  render theme-consistent scrollbar when content overflows. Check wheel,
  touchpad, drag and keyboard scrolling through long results and Queue in
  compact/expanded layouts; keep selection, search and playback behavior.
  State: OPEN; source investigation and owner desktop acceptance pending.

- [ ] **New boot/runtime warnings:** owner's log runs `0ea54cc09` and reaches
  the first frame; no startup Type-unavailable failure is shown. Investigate
  `qt.svg` unresolved paint server `a`, oversized SVG buffer, DelegateModel cancel
  `18 0`, repeated Wayland text-input disable and portal app-ID registration.
  Do not hide log categories as a fix. A bounded Qt audit reproduces missing
  paint references in WhiteSur's Obsidian icon and oversized filters in some
  WhiteSur icons even at 128px; exact attribution of the owner's `<input>:1:5634`
  and buffer messages remains open. Trace the model reset and popup/text-field
  focus lifecycle independently; preserve the redacted Weather location.

- [ ] **Calendar Popup Add/Edit Events text fields too small; event Remove button clipped — owner report 2026-10-10:**
  In **Calendar Popup → Add Event**, the text input boxes are visibly
  smaller/shorter than their text, reducing readability. Existing event
  **Remove** control is partly cut off. Restore sufficient field height and
  internal text baseline/padding to fit the actual font and placeholder at
  normal and scaled DPI; ensure the Remove control is fully visible and has
  an accessible click target without clipping the card, Popup edge or editor
  action row. Investigate the Calendar Popup embedded layout
  (`modules/bar/ClockCalendarContent.qml`,
  `modules/sidebarRight/events/EventsWidget.qml`,
  `EventsDialog.qml` embedded presentation, and `EventCard.qml`) to
  identify **which** remove control is clipped before changing its layout;
  `EventsDialog.qml` currently specifies 36px embedded text-field height
  and 30px embedded action buttons, but this alone does not prove the cause.
  Preserve compact Popup design and correct Add/Edit/Remove behavior; test
  long input text, placeholder, light/dark, font scaling, small screens,
  empty/populated calendar and add/edit/save/remove. State: OPEN; source
  diagnosis, native visual test and owner acceptance pending.

- [ ] **Weather popup overlap / Calendar-Weather Pyramid flicker — owner update 2026-10-10:**
  New case: rapidly hover between Calendar Popup and Weather Popup; Weather
  intermittently flashes. PyramidPopup coordination is a *suspected*, not
  established, cause. Inspect actual `AbyssPyramidCoordinator.qml` scheduling,
  source/body hover leases, z-order and native open/retract transitions;
  preserve Calendar and Weather functionality. Acceptance includes fast
  back-and-forth hover without flashes on relevant edges, exact-SHA Niri
  evidence and owner retest. Earlier case still OPEN: reproduce the video at
  `/home/llocphann/Videos/2026-10-10_00.19.58.mp4`, especially rapid Clock/other
  module → Weather transfer. The actual four-edge fixture passed 1,148 geometry
  samples at `0ea54cc09`; it did not change Weather production code or prove
  owner visual acceptance. Verify first hover, repeated reversal, Orbit/Details
  clipping, exit and reopen with the actual installed source identity.

- [ ] **Orbital Weather light-mode text:** hourly times/labels must use readable
  theme foreground colors. Qualify light and dark mode with the owner's image
  `/tmp/codex-clipboard-f953ac4b-1666-4bb5-8c16-b22920b1ee93.png`; remove the
  redundant hover tooltip instead of repeating the wheel's information.

- [ ] **Hover popups sometimes require clicks or stay open:** qualify cold
  boot and ordinary hover independently of Edit Layout and Waffle → Abyss
  remount. Verify every affected module, source-to-body transfer, reentry and
  final leave. Connected bridge input is repaired at `be8902259`; cold hover and
  delayed anchor callbacks have focused evidence in the archived ledger.
  Preserve click-only actions, keyboard focus and empty-space click-through.

- [ ] **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth popup text missing:** the loading blocker is fixed at
  `134b0115a`, and visible-title fixtures pass through `2d31f06b9`. Confirm actual
  owner populated/empty/loading/disabled states and actions. System Tray owns
  these icons; do not reintroduce standalone Wi-Fi/Bluetooth edge modules.

- [ ] **Music fails to play:** source `8b2ed6f0a` fixes queue/transport ordering,
  repeated payload stalls and failed-write retry. Real QML passes Python/Rust
  protocol fixtures; private real MPD plays synthetic WAV/FLAC and recovers from
  decoder failure using a null output. Confirm audible owner PipeWire playback,
  Stop → long idle → Play, queue/delete, Shuffle/Repeat and actual problematic
  FLAC files. Do not alter owner music bytes, queue or output routing as a test.

- [ ] **Volume +/- and DSP crackle — owner update 2026-10-10:**
  Intermittent audible distortion occurs when an EQ DSP-bearing Popup opens
  during active media playback. The suggested cause (preset automatically
  reapplied on each Popup open/close) remains an UNVERIFIED hypothesis.
  Qualify existing relative-volume queue, default/output routing and repeated
  keypresses. Observe DSP/EasyEffects preset writes, lifecycle subscriptions,
  analyzer restarts and output changes before attributing causality.
  Verify that selecting non-flat EQ and repeatedly opening/closing EQ Popups,
  Sidebar and Dashboard does not resend the preset, disrupt playback or crackle.
  CAVA warm/lifecycle fixtures are bounded source evidence; real audio, device
  and owner acceptance remain OPEN. Avoid changing owner presets during probes.

- [ ] **Edit Widgets / Dashboard Layout offset:** verify the connected toolbar
  stays outside the workspace with real widget dimensions. Exercise desktop
  and Dashboard/Overview editors, all/hidden widgets, occupied moves/resizes,
  packed restores, small viewport, Add, Cancel/Undo/Reset and save/reopen.
  Keep a finite workspace, readable minimums and unaffected neighboring cards.
  Owner reference: `/tmp/codex-clipboard-e908c001-f054-442e-a2bf-73cd2e70cd64.png`.

- [ ] **Modules cannot reach corners / IPC editing joins:** verify corner
  placement and edge clearance with modules, IPC previews and nearby surfaces.
  Keep the preview open despite normal OSD timeout; check Cancel/Done and
  per-output persistence. Source fixes do not replace physical input acceptance.

- [ ] **Clipboard and pinned Notes/Timers:** confirm copied images render
  correctly after refresh/reopen; Clipboard History must not toggle or flicker
  Dashboard whether it was initially open or closed. Verify Notes/Timers pin,
  add/remove and editor ownership across outputs. Native image/pin fixtures
  pass; owner's interactive acceptance remains distinct.

- [ ] **Wallpaper does not change on normal desktop:** source has repaired
  wallpaper ownership and live color preview. Confirm actual desktop application
  and Overview separately, rapid selection/cancel, output targeting, still/video
  image readiness and transition priming. A palette change alone is not proof
  that the selected wallpaper was applied.

- [ ] **Cheatsheet close opens Update popup:** qualify the repaired independent
  close/visibility ownership through first and repeated slide-out. No unrelated
  Update popup should appear or dismiss over it.

- [ ] **Notification timeout and retained history:** verify expiry, hover pause,
  resume and history refresh without resetting an existing timeout or pin.
  Preserve freely positioned notifications; retire obsolete Anchor controls.
  Niri reload success was subsequently retired and must remain silent; failures
  stay actionable. Verify Notification/Activity dimensions and existing Notes/
  To-do/Timers/Activities routes without duplicating their backends.

- [ ] **Hadalird helper/package state and Polkit focus:** extraction is
  source/package-qualified; owner reported helper status ready. Verify compact
  Settings status, restart/refresh, explicit install/reinstall/update/rollback/
  remove and retained data. Verify Polkit above embedded/native/Waffle Settings,
  success/cancel/focus restore and double authorization on a first install.
  Missing receipt must reconcile state, not retry a possibly successful install.
  No implicit privileged install or TLP/Thinkfan/charge-policy change.

## Correctness and release acceptance

- [ ] **Lifecycle/input on the installed candidate:** boot without unavailable
  types/duplicate IDs; cold/warm open, fullscreen enter/exit, lock/unlock,
  suspend/resume, output removal/hotplug and fractional/transformed outputs.
  Keep Overlay input limited to real interactive bodies; no transparent blocker
  or late callback invoking destroyed objects. Native debug Niri stays unfocused
  except for required image evidence and must have dark first-frame backgrounds.
  Verify normal tray/app hover menus, nested menus and newer-menu focus ownership,
  desktop context-menu close/reopen, Quick Notes editor leases, configured hot
  corners and Overview priority. Keep Calendar/Weather responsive at small scales.

- [ ] **Feature/package identity and failure behavior:** exact installed/source
  SHA, relocatable install/update/uninstall, required runtime dependencies and
  optional absence/error recovery. Exercise missing/offline/incompatible optional
  packages, actual selected TLP/Thinkfan/Obsidian behavior after user enablement,
  and Waffle separately. Nix-specific validation remains deferred/non-blocking.

No older canonical FAIL, STOPPED run, missing receipt or consumed G0 result is
upgraded to PASS by this consolidation. Their original boundaries are archived.
