# Rework/optimization

Work after actionable [Issues/bugs](ISSUES.md), unless the maintainer changes
the immediate priority. [The canonical audit](../../docs/optimization/STRICT_LOSSLESS_GPU_RAM_CPU_AUDIT.md)
holds technical research; this file holds pending outcomes.

## Resource use and responsiveness

- [ ] **Abyss Panel motion stutter — received/updated 2026-10-10:**
  Specific owner Notification Edgebar-hover and Recording-start stutters have
  independent reproductions in [Issues](ISSUES.md); keep this broad
  presentation optimization separate from those correctness investigations.
  Owner reports visible judder/jank while Abyss panels/Popups appear, disappear
  and transfer across edges; supplemental video `2026-10-10_13.34.50.mp4`
  is in the request (31.93 s at ~30 fps capture), not a frame-time/CPU/GPU
  trace and not committed to this repo. This is a concrete responsiveness
  acceptance under existing Connected presentation / strict-lossless research,
  not a new render-quality tier or permission to lower visual fidelity.
  Priority after actionable hover/correctness Issues. Profile cold/warm
  open, close, reversing mid-animation, rapid multi-edge switching and
  simultaneous/pyramidal panels; record actual frame time distribution
  (p50/p95/p99/dropped frames), main-thread CPU, compositor/GPU and
  allocations on comparable exact-SHA owner output sessions. Candidate:
  `AbyssGeometry.popupShoulders` produces per-scanline native input Regions
  during animations; investigate lossless adjacent-strip compaction and
  Instantiator/Region churn without dropping painted pixels, reordering
  input-source ownership or altering shader/animation cadence. Require
  pixel-union oracle, native pointer dwell/focus/click-through checks,
  visual parity and measured before/after; keep open until owner confirms
  perceptibly smooth transitions. Candidate `6c10387d18aa1793d7ad2f2ef20eb37020d69abf`
  now coalesces contiguous same-span SDF mask strips at construction, preserving
  pixel union and reducing native Region/Instantiator objects. Across 576
  independent 4-edge/scale/softness/radius/progress cases, static mask instances
  fell from 22,752 to 10,080 (55.7% fewer **Region rectangles only**, not FPS,
  CPU, GPU or RAM). Geometry contract test additions `38437f56` and native
  hover fixture additions `5a2cb977` are committed; an offline V8 run of the
  geometry test body passed 504,005 assertions with stubs. Source has **not**
  passed Quickshell/native compositor, canonical exact-SHA or owner visual
  acceptance. Next: serial native hover/geometry test first (Issues), then
  collect comparable before/after frame pacing and cost on installed source;
  if still visibly jerky, profile allocator/animation/ShaderEffect/wave frame
  paths before proposing another lossless candidate. Do not conflate Region
  reduction with a confirmed user-visible jank fix.

  **Owner still reports jank after `6c10387`, 2026-10-10:** that Region
  compaction/physical-mask patch was reverted in `0d26291646bc9b4db6f0678c54b10f7a4b8c8962`
  as ineffective. The earlier 55.7% rectangle reduction is now **historical
  only, NOT a current resource saving**. Do not stack another workaround on
  it. New independent strict-math hot-path candidate
  `b50c3b8064317fd8feb1ccd20303315765b2f2c8` reuses the immutable
  workspace rectangle and single popup record in `popupShoulders`, avoiding
  per-pixel object allocation/record-array traversal while preserving exactly
  the same SDF operations. Direct before/after V8 tests compared full
  shoulder rectangle arrays in **720 edge/scale/softness/radius/progress cases:
  identical**. Isolated loops of 2,000 calls measured 824→621ms at softness 24
  and 1,694→1,303ms at softness 48 (single V8 environment; not a whole-shell
  FPS/CPU/GPU/memory result). Native Qt/Quickshell has NOT been tested.
  To identify actual jank instead of guessing, opt-in diagnostics
  `1633a6e1d909de0c93e8a33999cccab1b78dcac3` adds
  `abyssHoverProbe.startFrames()` / `stopFrames()`: per-output bounded
  600 QQuickWindow `frameSwapped` wall-clock interval samples with
  p50/p95/p99 and interval gaps. Disabled until explicitly called, no
  recurring profiler/timer; results can include idle gaps and are NOT
  compositor-present timestamps or hardware GPU counters. Next: collect
  installed exact-SHA source, a real captured output/frame interval sample
  during slow open/reverse/multi-edge transitions, and CPU/GPU compositor
  evidence where available. Diagnose spikes in mask rebuild, allocator
  movement, ShaderEffect/waves, or focus/remount from evidence first.
  **USER-EXPERIENCE ACCEPTANCE REMAINS OPEN.** Exact source at
  `0ded4c9b388b407506add4029a7eb8985dc426fe` passed a second
  **offline V8** run of the current repository Node geometry test body:
  518,945 assertions, same predicate/serialization checks, using emulated
  Node asserts/readFile; still NOT Qt/Quickshell or canonical. A single
  read-only collection helper
  [`scripts/collect-abyss-hover-frames.sh`](../../scripts/collect-abyss-hover-frames.sh)
  captures frame interval samples without IPC polling and then separate
  timestamped hover state samples (no native compositor mask refresh).
  After installing the new exact source, run it while reproducing motion
  and transfer, preserve the three receipts and source/installed SHA. Do
  not report whole-shell FPS gain from V8 microbench timings, and do not
  call the previous Region-count reduction current after its revert.
  **First owner measurement attempt 2026-10-10 07:18:55 UTC was BLOCKED**:
  uploaded `frame-start.txt` reports Quickshell could not find its
  `default` configuration. It contains no frame intervals or FPS; uploaded
  `identity.txt` pins only the dev checkout `ff56015cf` and
  `qs_config=auto`, not the installed shell. This was caused by the original
  collector omitting the config path, whereas the Hadalis launcher uses
  `qs -p "$config_dir" ipc call`. Fixed diagnostic collector in
  `4dc295e7f118a2445ca5ab4d6a66de2552312532` to select the live iNiR
  instance and report installed/source parity. Corrected collector still
  requires owner rerun. **Jank cause and performance acceptance UNKNOWN/OPEN**;
  no percent/fps gain inferred from the failed capture.

  **Owner's second capture (2026-10-10 07:49:30Z), Niri/eDP-1:**
  `startFrames` succeeded and `stopFrames` returned 363 intervals,
  but recorded min/p50/p95/p99/max/mean all approx
  **1,791,001,362,433–1,791,001,362,477 ms** and all
  363 intervals were flagged over16/33/100 ms. These timings
  are **INVALID**, not evidence of low FPS: the old diagnostic
  stored `Date.now()` (~1.791e12 epoch milliseconds) in a
  signed 32-bit QML `property int _frameProbePreviousMs`,
  truncating the prior timestamp before subtraction. Example
  `1791618576306 - 617213874 = 1791001362432`;
  the spurious interval magnitude is explained by that exact
  integer overflow. Since the capture time is known and the 6-second
  window cannot cross the next signed-modulo epoch boundary, the constant
  offset is exactly `417 * 4294967296 = 1791001362432 ms`; subtracting
  this from the stored summary statistics recovers **approximate Qt
  frameSwapped intervals**: min=1ms, p50=17ms, p95=18ms, p99=41ms,
  max=45ms, mean=16.573ms (363 intervals). This DOES show a slow
  upper tail in *Qt wall-clock frameSwapped events*, but cannot
  assign cause to SDF/mask/GPU/compositor, cannot reconstruct threshold
  counts from the summary, and cannot prove the user's specific
  lag reproduction overlapped these frames. Thus raw counters
  `over16ms/over33ms/idleGapsOver100ms=363` remain INVALID.
  Diagnostic-only commit
  `b8be0fcb551a319fbff0b6c2a65c062f955c5ead` changes
  that property to QML `real`, not shell rendering itself.
  User-visible Panel lag remains **OPEN/UNMEASURED**.
  Commit `15f5abbb1bc19bf5377636dbee03c7f973713330`
  makes the collector auto-package complete/partial receipts into
  **one `.tar.gz`**, preserving original IPC exit status.
  Exact committed collector blob
  `defb45271438a80cc012d611467ce6c9451f264a`
  passed real `bash -n` (exit 0) and a fake `qs -p` run:
  success with 40 snapshots and one archive (exit 0), plus an
  explicit `startFrames` failure (exit 1, partial archive).
  Those are script tests, not Niri/Qt acceptance. Next: ensure
  running shell loads the updated QML, animate in PHASE 1,
  and provide the single archive with true bounded samples.

  **Owner second one-file capture 2026-10-10 08:04:04Z:**
  `hadalis-abyss-hover-20261010-150404.tar.gz` has
  `run-result.txt exit 0` but raw `frame-start.txt`
  is `Target not found.`, the stop reply has count=0 and
  null min/p50/p95/p99/max. On the actual owner-installed
  configuration `~/.config/quickshell/inir`, the
  `AbyssPerimeter.qml` file was **DIFFERENT from checkout**
  SHA `5896b425951a774f6b209d68b50616297f455a3c`.
  The other sampled source files matched. Thus latest frame
  timing probe was **NOT actually started**; the previous
  collector falsely accepted `qs` exit code 0 on a missing
  handler. No new frame-pacing values, FPS or root-cause
  conclusions were obtained from this archive.
  `faf8ad59b9336ad6d2689b20ace52b28f22a6d45`
  now refuses mismatched installed QML and invalid IPC
  replies and still emits one uploadable archive. Exact
  Git blob `d4f52cef9342defc1fde61d1c4dfacdd67ff4f54`
  passed `bash -n` and five mocked CLI cases with
  expected status 5/6/2/0/4 and valid archives.
  Synchronize with `./setup update` from `dev`
  before `inir restart`, confirm on-disk parity and
  run the probe during actual panel animations.
  **Owner lag confirmation remains OPEN.**

  **2026-10-10 08:26:41Z additional owner archive:** the QML installation
  now matches checkout `3acf9685ce7aef5e1c7e879e2437a7001ac3f874`
  for all three sampled files, but the live Quickshell IPC call to
  `abyssHoverProbe.startFrames()` still prints `Target not found.`.
  The bounded collector correctly aborted with exit 5 and packaged
  `run-result.txt`, `frame-start.txt`, `diagnostic-error.txt`,
  `identity.txt`. NO frame/hover samples were taken. A matching
  installed file is not proof the active Perimeter instance is mounted.
  Source gating requires Abyss family critical host, deferred
  readiness, and enabled `abyssPerimeter` module; active-state
  cause cannot be determined without live IPC inventory and host status.
  The read-only collector expansion `5462432e442048be32bf7de8e1227b892ed86e93`
  now includes `qs ipc show` and `abyssHostProbe.status()`
  diagnostic outputs within the same ONE archive; it also refuses
  a zero-count frame summary. No QML lifecycle or render
  settings were changed. Jank root cause and acceptance remain OPEN.

  **VALID owner Qt frame interval trace, 2026-10-10
  09:28:01Z, `eDP-1` on Niri:** archive
  `hadalis-abyss-hover-20261010-162800.tar.gz` was
  captured at checkout `a5ebffa747ddead7799d6dd6501f712996e068bf`
  and installed source parity MATCH for all 3 tracked files.
  IPC registry includes `abyssHoverProbe.startFrames`,
  `stopFrames`; actual start reply
  `[{"output":"eDP-1","started":true,"maxIntervals":600}]`.
  Frame stop reply: count=346, min=2ms, p50=17ms,
  p95=22ms, p99=76ms, max=86ms, mean=17.5983ms;
  intervals over16.7ms=208, over33.3ms=7,
  idle gaps over100ms=0. Sum of intervals ~6.09s.
  These are real bounded Qt `QQuickWindow.frameSwapped`
  **wall-clock intervals**, not compositor present/GPU
  timings, and are valid after the QML `int` overflow
  correction. A sparse slow tail is confirmed (7/346
  intervals exceeded 33.3ms), but the log does NOT timestamp
  individual outliers or prove the owner performed a
  specific animation during that 6s window.
  The `notificationCenter` popup was first observed
  only at hover sample #35 (~09:28:18Z), which was
  AFTER the separate frame measurement ended; do NOT
  attribute those 7 outliers to that exact popup reveal.
  No root cause, before/after speed-up or acceptable
  product smoothness claim is supported. **Lag remains OPEN.**

  To avoid losing the next hover-transfer event at the end
  of the original ~9.5-second, 40-snapshot phase, collector
  `d642cce966aea969a7f843180db82bece38e970a`
  now captures 100 bounded snapshots (~24s expected
  including IPC overhead, not an exact deadline).
  `1a0875d1b0fdd9c7f572d96e1a6e1d3c6cd90c00`
  adds read-only NotificationCenter hover-grace owner state
  to the popup slot snapshot. Neither alters rendering,
  frame scheduling, animation curves, shape nor
  native input. Next: exact installed-dev native capture,
  explicitly perform opening/reversal during Phase 1,
  open and cross popup during Phase 2, share ONE `.tar.gz`.
  Native acceptance on these latest diagnostic changes
  is still PENDING.

  **Owner archive 17:06 local, 2026-10-10 (checkout
  `418fcd9e9947cfadfe1b2453257751792875d623`):**
  This is NOT a new measurement of the prior p99=76ms
  slow-frame tail. The collector aborted exit 5:
  `abyssHoverProbe.startFrames` and its earlier snapshot
  both returned `Target not found.` because
  `abyssHostProbe.status` reported
  `deferredPanelsReady=false`, `perimeterLoaded=false`,
  `perimeterActive=false`, `initialMountReady=false`,
  `coldRecreatePending=true`. All three installed
  QML/JS parity checks MATCH. Runtime IPC target absence
  was directly observed; permanence vs transient boot race
  is unproven without a subsequent status.
  No frame-intervals or hover-snapshots payloads exist
  in the archive.
  `5bab2c774df7e2ecb5c0a446e3053a981323b1cd`
  adds bounded readiness polling (100 polls, 250ms apart,
  max ~25s) to the script, with `readiness-trace.log`,
  final status, clear timeout exit 7 and automatic partial
  archive, preventing premature `startFrames` calls while
  the Perimeter is unmounted. It does not change QML
  rendering, startup, compositor layers, animation or
  actual frame pacing. Await a native ready capture
  with explicit open/close/reverse of Abyss Panel before
  attributing any slow events to animation. **Lag remains OPEN.**

  **Owner VALID capture 2026-10-10 10:33:48Z,
  `hadalis-abyss-hover-20261010-173348.tar.gz`:**
  `dev` checkout `ffef7ef8ab5ca6107f11de959b33c404d644dd50`,
  three installed QML/JS comparisons MATCH, readiness attempt 0,
  active Niri `eDP-1` Perimeter, `startFrames` started=true,
  `stopFrames` returned **342** real Qt `frameSwapped`
  wall-clock intervals: min=0ms, p50=17ms, p95=19ms,
  p99=71ms, max=184ms, mean=17.6403508772ms,
  over16.7ms=193, over33.3ms=8,
  idleGapsOver100ms=3, maxIntervalCount=600 not exhausted.
  Valid slow tail persists (8/342 >33.3ms), with three
  >100ms gaps; include clock quantization and idle gaps.
  These are NOT GPU/compositor-present timings and the
  aggregate does not identify which precise Panel animation,
  if any, was running when the slow intervals occurred.
  NotificationCenter's two observable hover/open/retract
  cycles (#66–76 and #78–87) happened later during the
  separate hover phase; do NOT assign the frame samples
  to these popup events without new correlated evidence.
  Source-only `adc17c8b63b6f169005c11a193ab69343e6024ef`
  adds at most 40 timestamped slowEvents >33.3ms
  to the opt-in frame measurement: timestampMs,
  intervalMs and snapshot-only-on-outlier values
  for Bar visibility, liquid Popup presence,
  left/right Panel, Dashboard, Controls and Settings
  reveal progress. This only reads presentation state
  when a slow interval is observed; it does not alter
  timers, motion curves, shader quality or input masks.
  Still need the owner to open/close/reverse the intended
  Panel during PHASE 1 and submit a native archive
  with event timestamps. **Lag acceptance remains OPEN.**

  **Owner bounded trace 2026-10-10 10:44:39Z (17:44 local), exact
  checkout `ab1f52dd255c32a7626fd35fcaffceadf1b304eb`:**
  `hadalis-abyss-hover-20261010-174438.tar.gz`
  successfully measured **344** Qt `frameSwapped` wall-clock
  intervals: min=0ms, p50=17ms, p95=18ms, p99=40ms,
  max=161ms, mean=17.485465ms, >16.7ms=210,
  >33.3ms=4, >100ms=2. Compared with prior
  17:33 trace (342 intervals, p99=71ms, max=184ms,
  >33.3ms=8), this is a *different non-controlled
  six-second interaction*, NOT an optimization benchmark
  or measured performance improvement.
  New bounded `slowEvents` captured exactly four spikes:
  timestampMs=1791629083567 interval=161ms,
  1791629084032=40ms, 1791629085028=84ms,
  1791629085180=137ms. All four had
  `leftPanelProgress=rightPanelProgress=dashboardProgress=
  controlPanelProgress=settingsProgress=0`;
  Bar visible true for all, liquidPopupsOpen=true
  only for the later two spikes. Thus no observed
  Panel motion coincided with these four spikes; this
  does not establish that the user never moved a Panel
  or that GPU/compositor caused delays. Popup hover
  episode #67–96 belongs to the LATER sampling phase.
  Next: obtain a controlled native open/close/reverse
  Panel capture and compare slow-events against actual
  animation state. **Lag remains OPEN.**

  **Owner capture 2026-10-10 10:58:22Z

  all sampled panel progress=0. Four visible
  notification-center popup visits were subsequently
  observed during the SEPARATE hover phase
  (#15–29, #47–59, #70–77, #82–89).
  These intervals cannot be mapped to a specific
  opener/closer/reversal without animation state
  correlation. p99 dropping from 71→40→24ms across
  distinct owner-run traces is NOT a controlled
  before/after performance win or a resolved bug.
  FrameSlows remain real Qt wall-clock observations
  (not GPU/presentation timings).
  Diagnostic-only `d2db68cece00b95d06ec6915f51db94342c4d8da`
  now includes bounded `popupMotion` metadata
  (kind, requestedVisible, revealProgress) only
  when a slow interval occurs. No animation curve
  or compositor timing policy changed.
  Need one actual native Panel opening/reversal
  during the separate frame capture before a
  causality/optimization claim. **Lag remains OPEN.**

  **Owner 18:07 local native diagnostic**
  (`hadalis-abyss-hover-20261010-180711.tar.gz`):
  `dev` checkout `122d8e5f970102fc56919b450db5f7c42c54fa8e`,
  3 installed QML/JS checks MATCH, valid host
  `eDP-1`, collector exit 0, startFrames=true.
  `frameSwapped` wall-clock intervals: count=294,
  min=2ms, p50=17ms, p95=20ms, p99=188ms,
  max=612ms, mean=20.45918ms, over16.7=165,
  over33.3=6 and `idleGapsOver100ms=4`.
  Six timestamped intervals: 11:07:16.002Z=188ms,
  16.315Z=313ms, 16.931Z=612ms (these had
  popupsOpen=false and ALL sampled Panel progress 0);
  17.421Z=86ms with Notification Center
  revealProgress=0, requestedVisible=true;
  18.571Z=117ms with revealProgress=1;
  20.283Z=41ms with revealProgress=0.
  Those latter three still had all sampled Panel
  progress 0. They indicate concurrent Notification
  Center state at outliers but DO NOT establish
  compositor/GPU causation, whether a Panel moved
  BETWEEN frame samples, or work done in Qt between
  `frameSwapped` signals. The 100-snapshot hover
  phase was separate/later, containing six visits
  (five end before snapshot 100). Larger p99/max
  versus prior run demonstrates **measurement
  variability**, NOT a performance regression caused
  by the previous read-only diagnostic.

  **Follow-up, probe only:**
  `5760ed7b005ed15809bcf062868bd6e43f4136f5`
  adds three opt-in frame-window counters
  `panelNonzeroFrames`,
  `panelProgressChangedFrames` and
  `popupOpenFrames` so a frame sample that never
  observed a left/right/Dashboard/Controls/Settings
  Panel motion is distinguishable from a genuinely
  sampled reveal/retraction. This samples five
  already-existing numeric progress properties
  only while frame probing is explicitly active;
  no FPS policy, render quality, shader or
  animation curves are changed. Isolated test
  `scripts/test-abyss-frame-activity-probe.mjs`,
  committed `64fe2f589e6c6cdd9eb357f6c5808dff5c023fcf`,
  executes exact QML callbacks with a controlled
  0→.2→.6→1→.4→0 trace and a 73ms gap;
  all **12/12** assertions pass. Registered in
  canonical validator `bc74aeb9072a56f44031ac67978251129c227c15`.
  These counters have not yet run on owner Niri;
  full maintainer validator not executed at this SHA.
  Next capture MUST show nonzero
  `panelProgressChangedFrames` for a genuine
  Panel animation before attempting to optimize
  those transitions. **Lag acceptance remains OPEN.**

  **Owner 18:31 local source-pinned native trace:**
  `hadalis-abyss-hover-20261010-183130.tar.gz`,
  exact `dev` checkout `48ea131296a474faca11eda3dbdd97e1efa0f1c4`;
  all 3 installed source checks MATCH; collection exit=0.
  First preflight at 11:31:32.145Z: root family abyss,
  shellEntryReady=true, deferredPanelsReady=false,
  perimeterLoaded=false, pending cold re-create=true.
  Perimeter was constructed by 11:31:34.098Z but
  `nativeFirstFramesReady` stayed false until
  11:31:40.075Z; cold recreation was observed
  at 11:31:41.902Z; second Perimeter instance
  became native-frame-ready at 11:31:46.536Z
  (poll 28, approximately **14.4s** after preflight).
  This capture documents prolonged readiness/warm-up
  on this ONE startup, not the underlying compositor
  reason or a repeatable median boot regression.
  Current 600ms+450ms cold recreation policy comes
  from prior 0/16→16/16 native pointer recovery and
  must NOT be disabled on speculation.

  First valid bounded 6s `frameSwapped` trace AFTER
  readiness: count=210, p50=17ms, p95=52ms,
  p99=328ms, max=852ms, mean=28.4381ms,
  over33.3ms=15, idleGapsOver100ms=7,
  `panelNonzeroFrames=0`,
  `panelProgressChangedFrames=0`,
  `popupOpenFrames=162`.
  Largest frame gaps 852ms at 11:31:48.002Z
  and 663ms at 11:31:48.956Z occurred with
  liquidPopupsOpen=false, all five tracked Panel
  progress values 0, within 1.5–2.4s after
  readiness. A 328ms gap at 11:31:49.573Z
  coincided with NotificationCenter opening
  (`revealProgress≈0.0053`); later 95ms, 59ms,
  56ms and 38ms gaps also sampled Popup motion.
  Those sample correlations cannot prove GPU,
  compositor, Qt event-loop, shader, or popup
  animation root cause. The 100-snapshot hover
  measurement is later and separate; it showed
  4 notification popup visits and a long stable hold.
  This trace never sampled an active Left/Right,
  Dashboard, Controls or Settings Panel animation;
  **do not claim the user's Panel jank has been
  reproduced or fixed**.

  **Follow-up instrument, not performance treatment:**
  `1e06a5a7aca6b08a4bed3058a4944809ad823780`
  adds an opt-in 50ms Qt Timer heartbeat, bounded
  late-tick timestamps (>100ms gap), count/max,
  plus `barProgressChangedFrames` and Bar progress
  at slow-event timestamps. Running a timer
  only during the six-second explicit probe
  discriminates normal Qt event-loop cadence
  with sparse frameSwapped signals from correlated
  Qt timer lateness, though timer jitter is
  not GPU/compositor proof. No regular background
  timer or modification of input masks, animation
  duration, shader, cold-start remount occurs.
  `scripts/test-abyss-frame-activity-probe.mjs`
  now tests these exact QML functions and passes
  **20/20** deterministic source-level assertions
  (`ce1f272a99e3341d1262a2952b4e15af812ba3b0`,
  `87e42c3eb3c9525fde2756b40764a904c7e1da54`).
  Full native/new-checkout acceptance is PENDING.
  Preserve 18:31 trace as separate cold-tail sample;
  seek a fresh settled-shell Panel animation capture
  only if actual user-visible motion/jank persists.
  **Lag acceptance remains OPEN.**

  **Owner archive 19:03 local, 2026-10-10**
  (`hadalis-abyss-hover-20261010-190302.tar.gz`,
  exact `dev` checkout
  `1ce236724be81cf75d974ef4bb8433c62d10279b`):
  installed/checkout parity MATCH for 3 source files;
  cold readiness attempt 4 (~3.7s after preflight),
  host/Perimeter native readiness confirmed,
  collector exit 0. Output `eDP-1`,
  bounded frame sample count **277** (not exhausted),
  min=2ms, p50=17ms, p95=28ms, p99=132ms,
  max=844ms, mean=21.8989ms, over16.7ms=148,
  over33.3ms=13, over100ms=4.
  Panel state counters throughout the measured interval:
  `panelNonzeroFrames=0`,
  `panelProgressChangedFrames=0`,
  `barProgressChangedFrames=0`, `popupOpenFrames=166`.
  In other words, NO observed Left/Right/Dashboard/
  Controls/Settings/Bar animation was captured,
  while Notification Center popup was active
  for a substantial part of the sample window.

  The bounded 50ms Qt heartbeat was delivered
  112 times, with five intervals >100ms and a
  longest late interval of 293ms. At 12:03:09.951Z
  a swap interval of 844ms ended with
  Notification Center revealProgress≈0.008788,
  while a heartbeat late by 141ms ended
  at 12:03:09.845Z INSIDE that swap gap
  (approximately 09.107–09.951Z). Thus the
  Qt event loop was not completely blocked
  throughout the full 844ms; sparse swaps
  and event-loop lag are both plausible
  contributors, their root cause NOT proven.
  At 12:03:10.912Z a swap interval of 252ms
  ended with Notification Center fully shown;
  a 293ms heartbeat interval ended at
  12:03:10.929Z, overlapping that swap gap
  (approximately 10.660–10.912Z). This
  strongly supports correlated Qt timer
  lateness during part of the slow-swap event,
  but NOT compositor/GPU timing diagnosis.
  Slow-tail variability across 18:31 and
  19:03 cannot establish a source-level
  optimization or regression in the absence
  of controlled warm/cold repeated samples.

  **Read-only diagnostic continuation:**
  `974c881247870882a07ed1b0f5c6bf60783fe608`
  records the complete bounded 50ms heartbeat
  `heartbeatHistory` (cap 160 entries) during
  explicit `startFrames` only. Captures both
  normal and late Qt timer ticks, with timestamps
  and intervals, so later analysis can count
  how often the Qt event loop serviced the timer
  inside each observed frame-swapped gap.
  The focused extracted-QML regression,
  `468a1314d19dbefdfbb25f231f7cd05b2a339a4d`,
  passes **26/26** assertions (including null
  initial interval and bounded overflow).
  No window lifecycle, shader, input, render
  quality, animation or background event-loop
  behavior was modified. Native validation on
  this new diagnostic remains pending.

  **Next discrimination:** capture one truly
  settled-shell run WITHOUT restarting iNiR
  immediately before sampling, and deliberately
  activate a named Panel during PHASE 1. Compare
  with the cold-start-adjacent archive, ensure
  `panelProgressChangedFrames>0`, then correlate
  individual swaps against complete heartbeat
  chronology. If Panel motion is never sampled,
  do NOT claim a Panel-specific jank fix.
  **Lag still OPEN.**


- [ ] **Strict-lossless CPU/RAM/GPU reductions:** re-audit latest `dev` and
  promote high-value findings only after behavior, read/dependency order,
  identity/NOTIFY and lifecycle parity. Keep hidden services/lightweight warm
  surfaces fast to reopen, with heavy unused work asleep. Prefer strict lossless
  or one measured <1% trade for a large benefit; do not accumulate small trades.
  Measure comparable cold/warm/idle/active CPU, RSS, GPU/frames and latency;
  allocation or operation counts are not whole-shell resource percentages.

- [ ] **Audio Spectrum processing:** investigate the Round 49 profile-factor
  reuse candidate. Source count/profile/stereo/clamped strength are frame-invariant
  until configuration or shape changes. A candidate is prepared only in
  [the stop checkpoint's unpromoted candidate](../../docs/evidence/abyss-product/20261010-hover-checkpoint/unpromoted/bar-cava-candidate.qml)
  (copied from `/tmp/hadalis-bar-cava-candidate.qml`); product code is unchanged. Require actual
  QV4 exact sample/level parity, unchanged scratch/NOTIFY, strict render comparison
  and measured cost before implementing. Preserve upstream-like bounce, CAVA
  ownership, warm reopen and every animation/frame cadence.

- [ ] **Remaining optimization candidates:** read the current audit tail,
  distinguish CONFIRMED/HIGH CONFIDENCE from hypotheses and retire duplicates.
  Recent Notepad normalization, Overview record lookup and shared Search prefix
  findings still require their native reactivity/identity and measurement gates.
  Preserve filter-before-map observable reads in existing Abyss reductions.

- [ ] **Frozen visual qualification:** G0 `dc4d5ecfe118` remains
  `INCONCLUSIVE_CAPTURE_VARIANCE`. Analyze only saved receipt/PNG data offline;
  do not replay consumed lineage or lower strict RGBA. Do not change quality
  tiers on an unexplained translucent-pixel variance. Owner multi-output and
  whole-session resource acceptance remain separate.

## Alis Settings and Integrations redesign — owner request 2026-10-11

These items improve existing Settings/navigation and the optional integration
installer; they are NOT new third-party backends. Retain task status in Alis
dev even when implementation belongs to Alis-Intergration `main`.
Do not remove functionality, break direct Settings navigation or silently
run privileged installation just because manual buttons are retired.

- [ ] **SET-R01 — Eliminate redundant Settings-to-Settings navigation buttons:**
  The maintainer wants **no Settings action whose only purpose is to switch
  to another Settings tab/page**. Perform a complete source/UI audit of
  `modules/settings/**`, Waffle Settings pages and the shared Settings
  registry/search/deep-link navigation. Remove pure redirect cards/buttons,
  extra promotional links and duplicate destinations, **not functional
  controls**. Owner examples include **"Use opaque Material Appearance"**
  (first locate whether it is merely navigation or changes a real value),
  **"Configure Bar modules"** (confirmed `ModulesConfig.qml` → page
  `abyss-modules`), and other unnecessary tab-hopping UI. Verified
  candidates in `dev`: `ModulesConfig.qml` "Open Typography settings";
  `QuickConfig.qml` "Bar & layout/Taskbar settings", "Wallpaper settings",
  "Theme settings", "Capture settings"; `InterfaceConfig.qml`
  "Manage availability in Shell & interface"; `ServicesConfig.qml`
  "Bar weather module" and "Obsidian, Calendar and Music Recognition";
  `SidebarsConfig.qml` AI privacy/Policies and
  `GeneralConfigCore.qml` AI privacy. Inspect their actual effects and
  eliminate only **pure navigation** after verifying what is redundant.
  Preserve real controls (e.g. Open floating tools, reset, apply, install,
  search, breadcrumb/back and system confirmation actions), direct
  navigability via the standard Settings hierarchy, Settings search
  results, saved deep links and existing Waffle/Abyss functionality.
  Do not duplicate entire page content in the original page.
  Acceptance: Settings route inventory with action-by-action decisions,
  no unnecessary cross-tab button remaining, keyboard/Back/Escape,
  Settings search, saved page selection, themes and both shell families
  passing focused and native owner UI checks. State: OPEN for
  inventory/removal; no code changes yet.

- [ ] **INT-R01 — Move TLP and Thinkfan Settings into Integrations → Settings:**
  [Owners: Alis dev host + Alis-Intergration main optional views]
  Currently `modules/settings/GeneralConfig.qml` embeds
  `TlpPowerSettings` under **System → Power**, while
  `GeneralConfigCore.qml` embeds `ThinkfanSettings` under
  **System → Fan**. Move optional app-specific TLP and Thinkfan editors
  out of the System page and into **Integrations → Settings → TLP/
  Thinkfan** as proper app subtabs (same behavior for Abyss and Waffle
  through `WIntegrationsPage.qml`). Preserve Core Battery/Power
  Profiles, warning/suspend settings and generic fan readings where
  they belong; do not move basic host-owned functionality with the
  optional package. Fix `SettingsPageRegistryData.qml`, section
  search, legacy TLP page index 28, persisted selection, focused
  shortcuts/deep links and module lazy loading to route the old
  destinations to the new Integration subtabs. With optional
  package missing/off, present a concise unavailable state without
  loading plugin QML or silently installing it. Preserve real
  TLP/Thinkfan values, apply/rollback and trusted policy boundaries.
  State: OPEN; migration tests, cross-repo source identity and owner
  Settings acceptance required.

- [ ] **INT-R02 — Redesign Integrations around exactly two top-level tabs:**
  The Integrations page should have **Settings** and **Management**,
  with compact, clear design and responsive layout. **Settings**
  contains secondary tabs for each supported app, including TLP,
  Thinkfan, Obsidian and existing Calendar/Applications configuration
  where appropriate. **Management** owns third-party app enable/
  disable toggles, availability/version/health, progress, errors,
  optional package install/update/refresh and nonprivileged
  rollback/removal as appropriate; toggling never silently changes
  privileged host policies. Current `IntegrationsConfig.qml` has
  one tall "Optional integrations" management section mixed with
  Obsidian/Calendar/Applications navigation and direct manual Gateway/
  Helper actions; replace this with an accessible two-level navigation
  model instead of adding a duplicate layer of cards. Audit dynamic
  Integration settings from Alis-Intergration, unsupported packages,
  active worker/disabled state, empty/loading/errors, keyboard/back,
  narrow screens, long app names, responsive scrollbars, search and
  saved page restoration; Waffle `WIntegrationsPage.qml` delegates
  to the same shared component. **Gateway/Helpers install/remove
  controls do not belong in Management** once setup ownership is
  validated; display concise dependency state/error only if useful.
  State: OPEN; UI hierarchy, lazy source, native and owner acceptance.

- [ ] **INT-R03 — Installer-managed Gateway and Helpers across Alis setup lifecycle:**
  Move approved Gateway and Integration system-helper provisioning
  from manually pressed Settings buttons to the supported **Alis
  `./setup install` / reinstall / update** flows (and relevant
  package-managed paths). Audit actual supported setup subcommands
  and `sdata/subcmd-install/*`, migration/update/uninstall scripts,
  `scripts/hadalird-system-package.py`,
  `assets/helpers/inir-hadalird-system-provision`, system Polkit
  assets, `services/Hadalird.qml` and Alis-Intergration
  `Makefile`/`make install-helpers`. Automatically detect, reconcile
  and **prepare** the trusted, version-matched Gateway/Helpers so the
  user does not need separate manual Settings installation. Where
  privileged writes are required, use supported package-manager/
  Polkit/sudo authorization during setup with an **explicit prompt**;
  do not self-elevate silently, run a user checkout as root or
  bypass system ownership/security. If declined, missing, unsupported
  distribution or offline, keep Alis functional and report a clear
  deferred/unavailable state and safe retry path without falsely
  claiming successful installation. Never install third-party apps,
  enable TLP/Thinkfan services or change charge/fan policy merely
  because setup ran. Handle install, idempotent reinstall/update,
  source checksums/signatures, existing compatible binaries,
  partial/uncertain results, rollback, removal/uninstall and
  package ownership without duplicate helper versions. Remove
  **manual Gateway/Helpers buttons from Integrations** only after
  provisioning is verified; preserve observability, user consent and
  explicit helper-removal authority. Use
  `scripts/test-hadalird-gateway-bootstrap.py`, system provisioning,
  install lifecycle and Polkit tests plus a real authorized machine
  acceptance; tests must not mutate personal/system policy.
  Cross-reference existing privileged
  [Hadalird/Polkit Issue](ISSUES.md); do not duplicate an already
  indeterminate privileged action. State: OPEN, security/packaging
  design and explicit native install permission required.

- [ ] **ABYSS-R01 — Comfortable corner clearance in Edit Abyss Layout:**
  The user wants Screen Edge modules **visually close to, but never
  actually flush against**, physical screen corners while
  **Edit Abyss Layout** is active. Replace the current true-endpoint
  drop/snap packing with a small consistent **corner-safe inset** for
  module content/hit target: `modules/abyss/looks/AbyssLayout.js`
  currently uses `margin = 0` in both `snapMove` and `geometry`,
  and `scripts/test-abyss-module-layout.py` explicitly asserts a
  module can touch the physical endpoint. Update the source behavior
  AND those now-obsolete assertions, including deterministic drag,
  snap guides, start/end alignment, saved normalized positions,
  per-output overrides, compact layouts and all four edges/scales.
  Derive an aesthetically modest clearance token from existing
  edge/corner geometry and viewport bounds, not a large fixed
  exclusion that wastes space. Distinguish **module content clearance**
  from optional `joinCorner` visual field/Popup attachment:
  allow the selected decorative liquid connection to bridge the
  remaining gap without extending the actual interactive module
  into a hard corner or blocking Niri hot corners. Preserve
  collision packing, multi-selection work, small-monitor clipping,
  full Edit → Save/Cancel → reopen consistency and correct
  normal-mode rendering after the edited layout is committed.
  State: OPEN; design/source/unit/native visual tests and owner
  acceptance pending.

## Existing UI and layout

- [ ] **Quickshell typography consistency — owner request 2026-10-10:**
  Standardize inconsistent text appearance across Quickshell: review font
  family/fallback, size, weight, text color, alignment, line height and theme
  roles. Reuse shared text tokens without removing intentional heading/body
  hierarchy or legitimate Abyss/Waffle distinctions. Qualify Panel, Popup,
  Settings and edit surfaces at varying scales and light/dark themes. State:
  READY for UI audit; owner visual acceptance pending.

- [ ] **Compact Edit Abyss Layout control bar — owner request 2026-10-10:**
  Redesign controls for BOTH horizontal and vertical edit orientations to
  occupy less room while preserving discoverable actions, module context,
  per-edge editing, Cancel/Undo/Done, input targets and narrow-screen access.
  Test four edges, long labels, expanded edit controls and interaction with
  screen-edge modules; coordinate with new multi-selection functionality in
  [New features](NEW_FEATURES.md). State: READY for compact design; native
  input/layout and owner visual acceptance pending.

- [ ] **Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Popups about 35% smaller — owner request 2026-10-10:**
  Reduce each Popup's displayed footprint by roughly 35% (target about 65%
  of previous width/height where viable). Preserve readable status/rows,
  usable hit targets, connection/discovery, loading/error/empty states and
  scroll access. Test long networks/devices, small screens, all attached edges
  and scaling. Separate from existing Wi-Fi/Bluetooth missing-text bug in
  [Issues](ISSUES.md). State: READY for responsive sizing; owner acceptance open.

- [ ] **Monitor Arrangement tiles about 30% smaller — owner request 2026-10-10:**
  Reduce UI monitor tiles by roughly 30% (about 70% of former displayed width/
  height), never real display resolution or compositor placement. Maintain
  correct aspect labels, selection/dragging, snapping, multi-monitor layouts,
  non-overlapping controls and responsive hit targets. Related to existing
  Utilities acceptance in [New features](NEW_FEATURES.md), not a new backend.
  State: READY for presentation audit and owner desktop acceptance.

- [ ] **Quick Notes Edgebar scrolling sensitivity — owner request 2026-10-10:**
  Tune wheel/touchpad scroll speed for predictable navigation, including
  Shift-held scrolling while performing bulk selection. Inspect modifier/event
  routing and nested scroll containers; preserve range selection, existing
  note focus and selection state without unexpected horizontal scrolling,
  acceleration or skipped notes. Check long lists, trackpad/wheel, different
  scales and ordinary versus Shift navigation. State: READY for interaction
  tuning; preferred speed and owner acceptance require native input retest.

- [ ] **Edit Dashboard toolbar slide — received/updated 2026-10-10:** pushed
  `8c673129b58dbde73bf31c82df25c1085bf63e15` slides full-size connected controls
  from the attachment using the shared motion token. Input follows the clipped
  reveal; exit retains its footprint and releases input immediately. Native
  16 Dashboard/Overview × edge × size cases, reversal, complete exit, reduced
  motion, stable canvas and Undo/Cancel/Done pass. Its focused check also passes
  in the exact `10311cd96` canonical run, whose overall result is FAIL 327/8/1.
  State: source/focused-qualified; owner appearance acceptance still pending.
  [Durable focused evidence](../../docs/evidence/abyss-product/20261010-hover-checkpoint/hadalis-dashboard-toolbar-slide-motion-20261010.log).

- [ ] **Abyss Waves:** verify round crest-only geometry, no trough erosion or
  needle peaks, restrained breaker/whitewater, continuous distance attenuation,
  stable same/opposite-direction interaction and idle sleep. Preserve one shared
  wave-strength control/migration, optional/default-off waves and reduced motion.
  Calm stays below Balanced (the former Calm); Fluid/Deep should be distinct and
  restrained. Detailed wave controls belong to Custom; show numeric audio strength.

- [ ] **Screen Edge/module editor:** verify separate 0px-capable widths on all
  four edges, thickness-only versus inherited module sizing, per-module overrides,
  joined nearby modules when width does not affect them, nearest-corner joins
  and adjustable module curvature. Editor owns sizing with one-module partial/
  whole-edge choice, guides/snapping and saved per-output drafts. Dragging should
  not reload heavy content or persist the full config on each pointer event.

- [ ] **Connected presentation:** finish owner appearance acceptance for Popup,
  Sidebar, Dock, Dashboard, Settings, OSK and IPC on every edge and scale. Keep
  anchored full-size reveal/retract, readable reflow and older-body slide-close
  when allocation cannot fit. Center Sidebars on physical left/right edges;
  preserve custom dimensions and hot corners. Dock content must not shrink/jitter.
  Remove redundant tooltips, stray borders and repeated row fills while retaining
  intended enclosing-panel opacity/blur and click ripples.

- [ ] **Settings refinement:** compact iOS-like parent/child navigation, Abyss
  before Waffle, no duplicate destinations/headings or generated More groups,
  one editor entry beside Lock, stable order/search/deep links and complete lazy
  pages. Keep meaningful slider units and avoid multiplying Dashboard opacity
  twice. Qualify System Monitor two-digit widths/RPM icons and OSK content-sized
  footprint. Waffle remains supported; historical ii/
  style values serve safe migration/content reuse, not a removed live theme.

- [ ] **Dashboard Music presentation:** qualify horizontal page slide and
  centered dots on the controls/uptime row; Genre/Folders tabs and multi-selection,
  folder drilldown and combined result column, shared Media/EQ DSP, bottom-anchored
  upward Queue expansion, Lyrics auto-hide and responsive remaining widths.
  Source/focused native tests already cover these behaviors; owner video/input
  acceptance is pending. Playback correctness is tracked only in Issues/bugs.

- [ ] **Recording presentation:** `fafb4687b` connects one shared control set
  to the Abyss field/allocator/input mask while retaining ii/Waffle presentation.
  Native tests pass four-edge controls, drag, connection hover, auto-hide/recovery,
  Stop callback and idle/secondary-output allocation. Confirm owner appearance
  and an actual recording/stop. No owner recording was started/stopped in fixtures.

- [ ] **Wallpaper picker polish and live theme preview:** qualify the connected
  thumbnail selector against the supplied reference, restrained search icon,
  borderless action buttons and Abyss-styled tooltips. Remove `>wallpaper`,
  `(grid)` and `(overflow)` labels from the retired picker. Preview Edge/Panel/
  Popup colors while browsing images, restore on cancel and retain the chosen
  palette on apply. Actual wallpaper application is tracked in Issues/bugs.

## Product identity, CLI and upgrade compatibility

- [ ] **Rebrand iNiR/Hadalis public surfaces to Alis — owner request 2026-10-11:**
  "Rebranch" here means a full **product rebrand**, not a Git branch-history
  rewrite. The future public shell should consistently show **Alis** from
  first installation to normal daily operation. Preserve historical sources,
  evidence, externally owned Hadanion/Hadalird names and internal compatibility
  requirements. Do NOT blindly replace every occurrence of an old string.
  **Subtasks and acceptance, all OPEN:**
  - [ ] **R1 — Full rename inventory and classification:** enumerate iNiR,
    inir, Hadalis, old repo URLs, INIR_ environment variables, package/service
    names, QML app IDs, IPC targets, config/cache/data paths, shell strings,
    icons and translations. Tag each as user-facing rename, interface
    migration, compatibility alias, historical reference or external name.
    Produce a source-path/consumer matrix and prioritize risk before edits.
  - [ ] **R2 — Public identity consistency:** make active Shell/Panel/Popup,
    Notification/OSD, greeting, Settings/About, tooltips, tray/menu,
    application launch search, error/update/permissions messages and logs
    use one Alis name, product icon and localized terminology. Keep feature
    names Abyss, Waffle and iRiS, and meaningful legacy persisted enums.
  - [ ] **R3 — New install and greeting:** update setup and the installer
    greeting, FirstRunExperience.qml, welcome.qml and BootGreeting.qml.
    First installation must say "Welcome to Alis", display Alis as
    notification sender, offer accurate Alis commands, and keep text
    legible across supported locales/scales. Upgrading a current iNiR user
    must NOT retrigger the first-run wizard or lose wizard completion.
  - [ ] **R4 — Alis command and completions:** migrate scripts/inir and
    installed entry points to a discoverable alis CLI covering real
    run/start/restart/stop/service/status/settings/welcome/logs/doctor/update
    operations and existing supported flags. Update bash/fish/zsh completion,
    launcher hints, keybinds and command examples. Provide an explicit
    temporary inir forwarding compatibility command with regression tests.
  - [ ] **R5 — Quickshell/Niri/IPC/session naming:** plan ShellId, qs -p
    config selector, IPC instance targets, process detection, Niri binds,
    desktop activation and logs. Transition inir.service, compositor wants
    links and ExecStart/ExecStopPost to one new service owner. Never start two
    Quickshell sessions, lose IPC handles, reorder layer windows or break
    restart/cold-boot; preserve a verified rollback.
  - [ ] **R6 — Lossless user-data migration:** safely migrate or alias
    ~/.config/inir, ~/.config/quickshell/inir, cache/state/data, model
    directories and INIR_* overrides to Alis equivalents. Preserve legacy
    illogical-impulse compatibility chain, user settings, themes, layouts,
    first-run marker, notes, credentials, wallpaper paths, models and
    optional service preferences. Detect collisions and symlinks; back up,
    dry-run, make idempotent and fail closed instead of overwriting.
  - [ ] **R7 — Packages, desktop files, native helper ABI:** audit and
    revise .desktop metadata, desktop icons, Makefile, Arch PKGBUILD/SRCINFO,
    install/uninstall hooks, distro/Nix outputs, native/inir-* crates/binaries
    and packaged service assets. Explicitly map sockets, DBus names, Polkit
    action IDs, privileges, allowlists, package managers and ABI consumers
    before changing them; preserve compatibility where needed. No changes
    to standalone Hadalird/Hadanion repos without authorization.
  - [ ] **R8 — Active docs, updates and translations:** update project
    links including old llocphann/Hadalis update endpoints, onboarding
    screenshots, release docs, install guides, commands, messages and
    translated user-facing text. Do not destroy valid historical commit
    references or rewrite old investigation logs to appear new.
  - [ ] **R9 — Automated regression/upgrade matrix:** test new installs,
    in-place iNiR-to-Alis upgrades, mixed/partially migrated paths,
    failed/rollback migrations, XDG/PREFIX variations, systemd lifecycle,
    Niri startup, stale binaries, completions, source-sync and
    package-managed installs, optional helpers, uninstall/reinstall,
    preserved personal data and old-command alias. Run the canonical
    maintainer validator on the exact final SHA.
  - [ ] **R10 — Real owner-desktop release acceptance:** verify first-run
    greeting, shell app identity, every common Popup and system
    notification, Settings, IPC, startup/restart, CLI and rollback under
    real Niri/Quickshell. Prove no stray active iNiR public branding
    except explicitly retained compatibility warnings. Keep OPEN until
    the owner approves; no runtime changes were requested now.

  **Dependency:** coordinate the new performance profiler CLI and config
  identity in New features so both old/current installations can be traced
  safely during transition. State: planning only; NOT IMPLEMENTED.

## Cross-repository Companion and Intergration rework

**Central task intake 2026-10-11:** implementation owners are
[Alis-Companion](https://github.com/llocphann/Alis-Companion) main
(source snapshot 732136ef65bb3c84d9339207210c955759a85b76)
and [Alis-Intergration](https://github.com/llocphann/Alis-Intergration) main
(source snapshot b0c975a7f40bdf531012be326bc728f5c014b696).
These source SHAs identify the import, **not** the installed release or
acceptance. Alis dev holds the ONLY authoritative TODO status; package code,
test scripts and historical receipts remain in each source repository.


- [ ] **AC-R01 — Companion G1 performance, strict-lossless shaders and cost baseline (VIS-03/VIS-05):**
  [Owner: Alis-Companion main] Existing read-only CPU/RSS/PSS sampling
  and comparison scripts are implemented, but no qualified GPU frametime,
  VRAM or whole-shell p95/p99 G1 baseline exists. With exact Alis/Companion
  SHAs, real PIDs and matched hardware/power/DPR, repeat disabled, hidden,
  Aqua/Octo idle/moving/grip/cast and quality tier states at least 3
  times. Sample CPU/PSS separately from actual GPU/VRAM/frame pacing;
  report NOT_MEASURED where unsupported. After G0 passes, test one
  isolated WaterDropletMaterial.frag/OctoTentacle.frag E1 candidate at a
  time against strict RGBA and comparable AB/BA performance. No
  unapproved 2D/hybrid quality downgrade or "optimization %" without
  valid proof. Link to existing Alis Quickshell profiler and strict-lossless
  research; do not duplicate its backlog. State: G0/G1 gated.
  [Renderer source](https://github.com/llocphann/Alis-Companion/blob/732136ef65bb3c84d9339207210c955759a85b76/to-do/cloud-bot/ABYSS_WATER_DROPLET_COMPANION.md).

- [ ] **AC-R02 — Preserve original Aqua/Octo look and physical visual parity:**
  [Owner: Alis-Companion main] Keep one original 3D actor, existing 30
  animation clips per cast, 5.6-second Octo grip/quicksand, physically
  owned motion, palette/face/liquid/cups, pointer pass-through and
  portals for long movements only. Review eye normals/proportions,
  transparent water contact, shadows, four rims/corners, casts,
  fractional DPI, themes, quiet/low-power behavior and input ownership.
  Some native fixtures/source Blender staging passed; reference
  visual parity, GPU budget and owner acceptance remain OPEN.
  This does not replace the new cowork-laptop feature below.

- [ ] **AC-R03 — Existing Companion voice/persona and inference cost (AI P0):**
  [Owner: Alis-Companion main; host AI in Alis dev] JS/Python Aqua/Octo
  persona, reply guard and 14 EN/VN paired prompts already exist.
  Benchmark on an explicitly selected pinned real model/provider:

- [ ] **AI-R01 — Existing optional Integration Settings UI parity:**
  [Owner: Alis-Intergration main] Qualify existing TlpPowerSettings and
  Waffle equivalents, ThinkfanSettings, ObsidianThemeSettings and
  ObsidianTodoSettings for theme, readable labels, initial loading,
  backend missing/offline/disabled, error and scaling. Keep one source
  of truth for generic Alis Battery/Todo/Notes, preserve lazy disposable
  package worker lifecycle, native user focus and no implicit root
  actions. State: source implemented, owner visual/host qualification OPEN.

## Documentation maintenance

- [x] **Categorized tasks and shared AI workflow — completed 2026-10-10:**
  three active lists replace chronological/duplicate ledgers; 26 superseded
  documents are archived with evidence/current research preserved. AGENTS and
  all current entry points apply the same policy to Local and Cloud AI: classify
  on receipt, merge/split outcomes, select by category then impact/actionability,
  record dependencies and continue independent authorized work. Completion and
  seven-day archiving preserve unverified gates and concurrent status edits.
  Documentation contracts, Material-only docs, shared workflow links and diff
  checks pass. This is documentation validation, not runtime/desktop acceptance.
  Retain this recent completion until 2026-10-17, then move it to the dated
  chatbot archive.
